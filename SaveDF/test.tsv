"  We report results from numerical simulations of star formation in the early
universe that focus on gas at very high densities and very low metallicities.
We argue that the gas in the central regions of protogalactic halos will
fragment as long as it carries sufficient angular momentum. Rotation leads to
the build-up of massive disk-like structures which fragment to form protostars.
At metallicities Z ~ 10^-5 Zsun, dust cooling becomes effective and leads to a
sudden drop of temperature at densities above n = 10^12 cm^-3. This induces
vigorous fragmentation, leading to a very densely-packed cluster of low-mass
stars. This is the first stellar cluster. The mass function of stars peaks
below 1 Msun, similar to what is found in the solar neighborhood, and
comparable to the masses of the very-low metallicity subgiant stars recently
discovered in the halo of our Milky Way. We find that even purely primordial
gas can fragment at densities 10^14 cm^-3 < n < 10^16 cm^-3, although the
resulting mass function contains only a few objects (at least a factor of ten
less than the Z = 10^-5 Zsun mass function), and is biased towards higher
masses. A similar result is found for gas with Z = 10^-6 Zsun. Gas with Z <=
10^-6 Zsun behaves roughly isothermally at these densities (with polytropic
exponent gamma ~ 1.06) and the massive disk-like structures that form due to
angular momentum conservation will be marginally unstable. As fragmentation is
less efficient, we expect stars with Z <= 10^-6 Zsun to be massive, with masses
in excess of several tens of solar masses, consistent with the results from
previous studies.

"Tobacco is an annual crop grown primarily by small farmers throughout the world.  It can be harvested from September through November depending on where you're growing it.   The most common types of tobacco used worldwide include Burley, Virginia flue-cured, Oriental, Turkish, and cigar varieties.    You may also find specialty tobaccos such as Perique, Cavendish, Latakia, Black cavendish, Connecticut shade-grown, and other rare blends available online or locally.     Tobacco has been cultivated since ancient times; however, its use was banned during many periods due to health concerns related to smoking cigarettes and chewing tobacco products.       ...

Growing Conditions
The ideal temperature range for growing tobacco ranges between 65–75 degrees Fahrenheit (18-24 °C).    However, tobacco thrives under a wide variety of climates including mild winters and cool summers.       In general, tobacco grows well in areas with high humidity levels and plenty of rain.      If possible, choose a location away from direct sunlight so that the plants don't get scorched by the sun's rays.    Choose a spot near a source of fresh air because tobacco smoke tends to linger long after you've finished using it.    Planting Seeds"	1

"I often go to the animal shelter in my city to take the dogs out for a walk. There was this adorable american bull terrier (or something like that) that the owner had kicked out of his car in a parking lot. The animal shelter named him Spooky for some reason and the dog would NOT listen to that name, he'd drag me through the park while I called his name to no avail. At one point the animal shelter put his picture on their facebook and one lady freaked out because it was her dog who she gave to a aquintance (who then left the dog in the parking lot). She refused to pick up the dog because she didn't want to pay for his stay (130euros). She said in the comments that his real name was Neo. Next time I took him for a walk he was pulling the leash again, dragging me behind him until I yelled 'Neo, stay!'. As soon as he heard his name his ears perked up, he started to waggel his stumpy piece of tail and stayed right next to me the entire walk, amazing sweet dog who got adopted a few weeks later :)


Edit: I've found an old picture of Neo :) _URL_0_"	0
"was a Japanese sumo wrestler from the Tokugawa era, who is officially recognized as the fourth yokozuna, and the first to be awarded the title of yokozuna within his own lifetime. He achieved great fame and though championships were not awarded in his era, he achieved the mathematical equivalent of 21 tournament championships. He was also the coach of Raiden Tameemon.

Early career 
Tanikaze was born  in Miyagi District, Mutsu Province (now part of Wakabayashi-ku, Sendai). He made his debut in sumo in 1769 when he was 19. With a height of 189 cm and a weight of 169 kg, he was extremely large in comparison with most Japanese men of his era.

In this period, local men with a large physique but often little to no sumo background were asked to enter sumo tournaments. They would debut as kanban or ""guest"" ōzeki and in most cases their ""careers"" were short-lived. This is how Tanikaze, due to his size, debuted in 1769. He chose to stay active in sumo however, and would eventually be promoted to a true ōzeki outright in March 1781. From October 1777 until February 1786, he lost only one bout. This was to Onogawa in February 1782. He recorded the longest run of consecutive victories in sumo bouts at that time, with 63. This record remained unbroken for about 150 years, until Futabayama in 1938.

Yokozuna
On November 19, 1789, he became one of the first two sumo wrestlers to be allowed to perform a yokozuna dohyō-iri (a special ring-entrance ceremony for the yokozuna alone, rather than entering as part of a parade of the top ranked wrestlers). Both he and Onogawa were granted a special so-called yokozuna license simultaneously in that year. Officially he is recorded as being the 4th yokozuna in sumo history. However, as the first three (see list of yokozuna), if indeed they existed at all, were awarded the title posthumously, he can be said to be one of the first two real holders of the title.

He was still an active wrestler when he died at the age of 44 of influenza. He was on another winning streak of 35 bouts at the time of his death. In the top makuuchi division, Tanikaze won 258 bouts and lost only 14 bouts, achieving a winning percentage of 94.9.

Tanikaze was a very popular rikishi. Unlike other wrestlers of his day, many nishikie (woodblock print based) portraits and images of him participating in bouts still remain.

Family
He had a younger brother, Dategaseki Moriemon (1756-1807), who was also a sumo wrestler and reached the top division himself in 1791. They were the second pair of brothers in sumo history to both reach makuuchi.

Top division record

The actual time the tournaments were held during the year in this period often varied.
Tanikaze's first three tournaments were as a ""guest"" ōzeki, see above.
Tanikaze's record for the Spring 1776 tournament is unknown.

", They starts with the unit (for example, ""fem""), and ends with ""-tio"". However, not all follow this rule, so read ahead:


Tjugo (pronunciation: ɕʉːgʊ) - twenty - 20

,


Trettio (pronunciation: trɛtɪ) - thirty - 30
Fyrtio (pronunciation: fœrtɪ) - forty - 40
Femtio (pronunciation: fɛmtɪ) - fifty - 50
Sextio (pronunciation: sɛkstɪ) - sixty - 60
Sjuttio (pronunciation: ɧɵtɪ) - seventy - 70
Åttio (pronunciation: ɔtɪ) - eighty - 80
Nittio (pronunciation: nɪtɪ) - ninety - 90

, To say a such number in Swedish, you replace the ""somethingty"" with the Swedish translation (let's say you want to say 95 in Swedish - then you first replace ""ninety"" with ""nittio""), and then say the unit directly after (you replace ""five"" with ""fem"", and also remove the ""-""). E.g., 95, 23, 54, and 33 are written ""nittiofem"", ""tjugotre"" (""twenty""=""tjugo"" and ""three""=""tre""), ""femtiofyra"" (""fifty""=""femtio"" and ""four""=""fyra"") and ""trettiotre"" (""thirty""=""trettio"" and ""three""=""tre"").

, 100 is said ""hundra"" (pronunciation: hɵndra), 1000 is ""tusen"" (pronunciation: tʉːsɛn) and 10000 is ""tiotusen"" (see pronunciation for ""tio"", ten, and ""tusen"", thousand). It is quite easy; you just add the larger number before the rest, as in English. If there is not just one larger number, such as 2000, then you add that number first, as in English. The same applies if there are many ""huge numbers"". You do never say ""och"" (""and"") between the numbers, and you never put a ""-"" there either. If you want to say 3502, then you say ""tretusenfemhundratvå"" (if you have trouble reading it, then try this: ""tre-tusen-fem-hundra-två"", ""three-thousand-five-hundred-two""; however, you should not write with ""-""-marks).

"The Congolese Air Force (, or FAC) is the air force branch of the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Congo-Kinshasa). From 1971 to 1997, it was known as the Zairian Air Force (, or FAZA).

History 

Shortly after the Congo became independent in 1960, the province of Katanga seceded, and the newly formed State of Katanga began building its own army. The Katangese seized most of the aircraft operated by the Aviation de la Force Publique and created the Katangese Air Force. The Congolese Air Force was created in mid-1961 largely to oppose the new Katangese Air Force. In 1963, Katanga was defeated by United Nations forces in Operation Grandslam, and the remaining assets of the Katangese Armed Forces were integrated into the Congolese Air Force.

A Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) front company, Anstalt WIGMO, provided maintenance support to large parts of the FAC in the 1964–1968 period. The CIA also provided aircraft during the same period and pilots from late 1962 onwards.

In July 1970 the Institute for Strategic Studies described the  (FAZ) as numbering 650 with 21 combat aircraft. Aircraft strength was listed as ten T-6 Texan and eight T-28 Trojan armed trainers, two DC-4 and ten DC-3 transports, and six Alouette helicopters. The ISS said that 17 MB-326GB ground attack/trainer aircraft were on order, of which about five had been received.

In July 1974 the International Institute for Strategic Studies described the FAZ as numbering 800 personnel with 33 aircraft. The Military Balance for 1974–75 listed one fighter wing with 17 MB-326GB, 6 AT-6G and 10 T-28 armed trainers, one transport wing with 9 C-47, 4 C-54, and 3 C-130, one training wing with 8 T-6 and 12 SF-260MC, and one helicopter squadron with 20 Aérospatiale Alouette II/III and 7 Aérospatiale SA 330 Pumas. It noted that 17 Mirage V and 3 C-130H were on order.

The Air Combat Information Group states that by the mid-1980s the FAZ suffered from the same problems as the rest of the Zairian Armed Forces, including lack of funding and widespread corruption. According to FAZA helicopter pilot Pierre Yambuya's tell-all memoir, he regularly had to perform so-called ""special missions"", consisting of moving prisoners to places where they were tortured or assassinated. On other occasions, he had to drop packages of up to 600 kg. filled with corpses and debris in a river.

In the 1980s the air force was theoretically organised into the , at Kinshasa (N'djili Airport?), with the 19th Logistics Support Wing (C-130s and Dakotas), the 12th Liaison Wing (helicopters, MU-2Js, and Cessna 310Rs) and the 13th Training Wing. The  at Kamina comprised the 21st Fighter-Attack Wing with Mirage 5s and MB.326Ks, and the 22nd Tactical Transport Wing, with 221 Squadron operating the two of three originally delivered Buffalos.

The extreme corruption of the force meant that Zairian aircraft were more often used for private 'business' of their fliers and their superiors than operations against rebels. From an originally delivered eight Dassault Mirage 5Ms, only seven were left by 1988, with five being lost in different accidents. By the mid-1990s the last three were sold. Michela Wrong's In the Footsteps of Mr. Kurtz: Living on the Brink of Disaster in the Congo reports a story that the remaining Mirages were sold in France whilst there for maintenance, in order to finance a Zairian Air Force commander's retirement.

The FAZ played little part in the First Congo War, with most aircraft inoperable. Some aircraft were imported and used by Serbian mercenaries, but had little operational effect. The FAC has reportedly hired Georgian ex-military pilots to train FARDC pilots in counterinsurgency operations, who may also have participated in combat operations.

Current structure 
As of 2007, all military aircraft in the Democratic Republic of the Congo were operated by the Air Force. Jane's World Air Forces states that the Air Force has an estimated strength of 1,800 personnel and is organised into two Air Groups. These Groups command five wings and nine squadrons, of which not all are operational. 1 Air Group is located at Kinshasa and consists of Liaison Wing, Training Wing and Logistical Wing and has a strength of five squadrons. 2 Tactical Air Group is located at Kamina and consists of Pursuit and Attack Wing and Tactical Transport Wing and has a strength of four squadrons. Foreign private military companies have reportedly been contracted to provide the DRC's aerial reconnaissance capability using small propeller aircraft fitted with sophisticated equipment. Jane's states that People's Air and Air Defence Force of Angola fighter aircraft would be made available to defend Kinshasa if it came under attack.

Like the other services, the Congolese Air Force is not capable of carrying out its responsibilities. Few of the Air Force's aircraft are currently flyable or capable of being restored to service and it is unclear whether the Air Force is capable of maintaining even unsophisticated aircraft. Moreover, Jane's states that the Air Force's Ecole de Pilotage is 'in near total disarray' though Belgium has offered to restart the Air Force's pilot training program.

Aircraft 
According to Flight International 2004 and IISS Military Balance 2007 past aircraft have included the MiG-23 Flogger, the Lockheed C-130 Hercules, the de Havilland Canada DHC-5 Buffalo, the North American T-28 Trojan, and the Eurocopter AS332 Super Puma.
Jane's World Air Forces 2007 states that the Air Force operates between 9 and 22 Mil Mi-24/35s attack helicopters, and a single Mi-26. The condition of the DRC's aircraft which are not currently in service is generally so poor that they cannot be repaired and returned to flyable status.
The DRC's single Mil Mi-26 'Halo' was shown as a photo in Air Forces Monthly (AFM)'s July 2007 issue without obvious rust and appearing to be in good condition which was taken on April 12, 2007, at Lubumbashi. It was delivered in 2005. AFM says that a second Mi-26 prepared for the DRC has been stored with Skytech at Liège Airport, Belgium since at least June 2002. As of 2015 the table below displays aircraft presently in flyable condition.

A report on the Facebook page of Scramble magazine in December 2018 shows a Hawker Siddeley Andover, Douglas DC-8-55F and Boeing 737 aircraft in use by the DRC-AF at Kinshasa.

"The authors introduce a new memory model which allows memory access in O(log n) time.

Pros:
* The paper is well written and everything is clear.
* It's a new model and I'm not aware of a similar model.
* It's clear that memory access time is an issue for longer sequences and it is clear how this model solves this problem.

Cons:
* The motivation for O(log n) access time is to be able to use the model on very long sequences. While it is clear from the definition that the computation time is low because of its design, it is not clear that the model will really generalize well to very long sequences.
* The model was also not tested on any real-world task.

I think such experiments should be added to show whether the model really works on long sequences and real-world tasks, otherwise it is not clear if this is a useful model.

"The starting point of this work is the understanding that by having decorrelated neurons (e.g. neurons that only fire on background, or only on foreground regions) one provides independent pieces of information to the subsequent decisions. As such one gives ""complementary viewpoints"" of the input to the subsequent layers, which can be thought of as performing ensembling/expert combination within the model, rather than using an ensemble of networks. 

For this, the authors propose a sensible method to decorrelate the activations of intermediate neurons, with the aim of delivering complementary inputs to the final classification layers: they split intermediate neurons to a ""foreground"" and a ""background"" subset, and append side-losses that force them to be zero on background and foreground pixels respectively. 

They demonstrate that this can improve classification on a mid-scale classification example (a fraction of imagenet, and a ResNet with 18, rather than 150 layers), when compared to a ""vanilla"" baseline that does not use these losses.

I enjoyed reading the paper because the idea is simple, smart, and seems to be effective. 
But there are a few concerns;
-firstly, the way of doing this seems very particular to vision. In vision one knows that masking the features (during both training and testing) helps, e.g. "	0
"  This article is a thorough critique to the Weniger's comments made to our
papers published in prestigious journals in the recent years. A detailed and
critical examination of the arguments that led to the suggested comment by
Weniger reveals some serious flaws. In our published papers we have shown that
the unsymmetrical and symmetrical one-range addition theorems for Slater type
orbitals, Coulomb-Yukawa like correlated interaction potentials (CIPs) and
their derivatives are derived from the expansions in terms of -ETOs that are
complete and orthonormal sets of exponential type orbitals in corresponding
Hilbert spaces, where The concrete criticism raised in Weniger's comment
against our papers actually touches a very minor aspect of the works that are
not relevant at all for the conclusions, which are made. As can be seen from
our papers, all of the formulas for different kinds of multicenter integrals
over Slater type orbitals with integer and noninteger principal quantum numbers
obtained by the use of unsymmetrical and symmetrical one-range addition
theorems were tested by computer calculations. We reject the Weniger's personal
views about papers published by Guseinov and his coworkers from 1978 to 2006
and respectable referees on one-range addition theorems and multicenter
integrals. All claims of inconsistencies and flaws in the theoretical framework
are rejected as unfounded. This rejoinder paper contains all of the answers to
Weniger's comments.

"This paper proposes a new kind of expert model where a sparse subset of most reliable experts is chosen instead of the usual logarithmic opinion pool of a PoE.
I find the paper very unclear. I tried to find a proper definition of the joint model p(x,z) but could not extract this from the text. The proposed “EM-like” algorithm should then also follow directly from this definition. At this point I do not see if such as definition even exists. In other words, is there is an objective function on which the iterates of the proposed algorithm are guaranteed to improve on the train data?

" They need to play no part, it's best to be around people you enjoy being with as this will help you feel at ease.;
, Clothes, hair, aftershave, teeth - nothing over the top, dress appropriately, comfortable a must! 4 sprays of aftershave - behind each ear and on each shoulder. Nothing extreme, no bright colors, relaxed approach (unless you are heading somewhere which requires this).

, People go to these places knowing there are going to be other people there. They are prepared to TALK.

, You are not trying to pull tonight, you are still in training. With a pub as a scenario, don't hang outside the toilets waiting for your prey! Instead - go solo at the bar (this may sound scary, but this way no pressure, your friends can sometimes be off putting). When ordering drinks, look around casually, if you make eye contact with someone - SMILE but then turn away, remember these are skill building techniques.

, DO NOT ask for a date right now

,, If you are a guy asking a girl, remember this can be delicate - I would recommend the initial meeting place to be the same venue as when you first met - the reason for this is it's a familiar place to your date and will help to make them feel at ease.

, Pre date nerves - don't worry, they will feel exactly the same!

, Remember you have one the hard part, this is now easy, you have clicked already, you have spoken, now you use this time to get to know each other. Make sure you show interest in your date, combine talking about yourself to asking questions about them and it should work both ways.

, That's down to you and your date how quickly you'd like to progress things. Just go with the flow, the combination of two people is a natural occurrence and the first kiss is included, you will both know when the time is right.

"Major Sir Keith Alexander Fraser, 5th Baronet (1867–1935) was a British cavalry officer, and a Conservative Member of Parliament for Harborough from 1918 until 1923.

Biography
Keith Fraser was born in 1867. He was the son of General James Keith Fraser (the third son of Sir James John Fraser, 3rd Baronet (d. 1834)), and his wife Amelia Alice Julia (daughter of the Humble Dudley Ward). He was educated at Eaton.

Fraser joined the 7th Queen's Own Hussars and as a captain saw active service with his regiment in Southern Africa. He fought in the First Matabele War (in what is now Zimbabwe) and was awarded the British South Africa Company Medal in 1893. He also saw action in the Second Matabele War and was awarded the clasp in 1897.

Fraser succeeded his cousin Sir William Augustus Fraser, 4th Baronet to the title of baronet in 1898. He contested the Parliamentary seat of Caithness-shire in 1906, and the Bosworth division of Leicestershire in January 1910. He was Conservative Member of Parliament for Harborough from 1918 until 1923.

Fraser was a friend of Baden Powell and presented the Fraser Shield to the Boy Scouts in 1912 and the Fraser Shield Camping Competition is now thought by the organisers to be the longest running camping competition in Scouting.

Family
Fraser married Dorothy (daughter of George, 9th Earl of Coventry) on  30 August 1910. In 1911 they had a son Keith Charles Adolphus Fraser who was born in London.

"The Local Journalism Sustainability Act () is a bill introduced into the United States House of Representatives on July 16, 2020, by Representative Ann Kirkpatrick (D-AZ-2). On November 12, it received another co-sponsor bringing the total to 78 (20 Republicans and 58 Democrats).  This act would provide tax credits to support local newspapers:  

 Up to $250 per year per individual to cover 80 percent of subscription fees to local newspapers for the first tax year and 50 percent for subsequent tax years (4-1 match the first year, 1-1 match for an additional four years).
 Up to $12,500 per quarter ($50,000 per year) to reduce employment taxes for a local newspaper to hire and pay journalists.
 Up to $5,000 per year for a small business to cover 80 percent of advertising with local media (local newspapers or broadcast stations) the first year after this act takes effect and up to $2,500 per year for another four years to cover 50 percent of such advertising.  
 
This act defines a ‘local newspaper’ as any print or digital publication whose (A) primary content is news and current events, and (B) at least 51 percent of its readers (including both print and digital versions) reside in a single (i) State or a single possession of the United States, or (ii) area with a 200-mile radius.  To qualify, a 'local newspaper' must have been in continuous operation for two years prior to the enactment of this bill.

The bill was reintroduced to the 117th congress in 2021 ( and ).

Discussion  

On July 21, 2020, The Arizona Republic discussed this bill, noting that, “More than 150 news companies and papers have undergone pay cuts, furloughs, layoffs or even shut their doors for good as a result of the pandemic, according to the Poynter Institute, a journalism think tank."" More recent reports from the Poynter Institute document further reductions in news. 

The bill is supported by multiple organizations concerned about the decline of local newspapers and the threat that poses to democracy.

 David Chavern, the President and CEO of News Media Alliance, wrote, ""As journalists are on the front lines reporting on the coronavirus crisis, ... local news publishers have been dealt a major blow from the contraction of the local advertising market. The Local Journalism Sustainability Act ... would help ensure local news publishers survive the current crises, and that they are around to cover the next ones.""

 Dean Ridings, CEO of America’s Newspapers, reminded readers of what happened to Bell, California, a suburb of Los Angeles with only 37,000 people of modest incomes, after its local newspaper died in 1998 or shortly thereafter:  When the Los Angeles Times started reporting on it in  2010, the city was almost bankrupt in spite of major tax increases, because the city council had voted huge increases in annual compensation to roughly $100,000 for council members, $450,000 for the police chief, and almost $800,000 for the city manager.

 Other supporters include Editor & Publisher, an American monthly magazine serving the newspaper industry, and the Hoosier State Press Association. 

Jack Shafer, who writes about media for Politico, said, “Nobody will miss newspapers more than me when they finally vanish.” However, publishers and journalist may not honestly report on certain issues and events, given the history of politicians (usually Republicans like Mr. Trump) threatening to defund NPR and PBS when they don't like the coverage. He asked, ""You wouldn't put a dead man on a ventilator, would you?"" Editor and Publisher Magazine took position to Shafer's opinions about the eventual death of newspapers in a 2020 editorial penned by Publisher Mike Blinder, which stated ""there are thousands of smaller community newspapers that are still operating with decent profits and serving their communities that lack other news outlets."" And went on to cite: ""Community publishers generally operate with much more efficiencies than the big market dailies and have better relationships with the local advertising community. Plus, they perform a necessary, critical service (as mandated in the Constitution) of making the local government accountable to the people they serve, or as some say: “Speak truth to power.” These are the cities and counties that must continue to have an authoritative, credible voice through this crisis and beyond.

The store buys in bulk, which reduces their cost per item sold.  This also allows them to sell items that are not available elsewhere (such as discontinued or limited edition). The store may buy from another retailer who has purchased large quantities directly from manufacturers. They will then resell this product under its own name rather than the manufacturer's name. Some retailers have contracts with specific brands where they agree on certain prices so when you purchase an item through one retailer but find it cheaper somewhere else it's because your retailer doesn't pay what he agreed upon. Retailers can also make money by selling something like shampoo without paying any taxes since they're considered non-alcoholic beverages even though alcohol isn't actually present. Because most people don't know how much tax goes into making things such as shampoo etc., they think buying from Walmart saves them some money. However, if you're looking for quality goods look no further!	1
"Cop here. Short answer is, it depends.

If it's a serious crime and the drugs and money were evidence, the drugs and money will be retained in evidence for 5-7 years for potential appeals, or longer, depending on the wishes of the prosecution.

If the crime isn't so serious (as in 2-3 years or less) and the money wasn't proven to be derived from, or in furtherance to, illicit activity, it will most likely be returned to the owner. (This follows the same asset forfeiture laws as vehicles, houses, boats, clothing, etc. so a separate hearing is usually initiated to test/verify if the money was illicit.) 

Each jurisdiction has their own set of rules, regulations, and laws, but generally the drugs and money will either be disposed of (by at least two witnesses) or they will be kept. (Drugs can be used for training or future investigative operations. Money goes back to the parent government, NOT the seizing agency.) There is usually some forms that need to be filled out and approved by the chief of the law enforcement organization and the prosecutor's office and/or judge. 

If the drugs are kept, they are stored in the property/evidence room and only checked out for operations/training - they're weighed when they leave and weighed again when they come back. If there's any missing and it wasn't used in an approved training or operation, it would be your ass. The drugs could be used for K-9 training or controlled burns (how do you think that cops and confidential informants know what marijuana smells like - they, like the dogs, have to have it signed off in their personnel/training records.) We will also use it to do field test training for those that don't get a lot of exposure to it (probation/parole officers, investigative assistants, confidential informants etc.) Operations is what you suspect - reverse buy/busts or buy/walks. 

As I said, money that has been seized (and approved for forfeiture during a hearing) funnels back to the parent government and they disburse it as they see fit. At the Federal level, that is the Department of Justice."	0
Kaira is the name of several species in different families within Araneae, including Kaira alba and Kaira trivia from the family Salticidae; Kaira crassipes from the family Gnaphosidae; Kaira sp.

"  Initial reaction rate data for lactic dehydrogenase / pyruvate, lactic
dehydrogenase / lactate and malic dehydrogenase / malate enzyme reactions were
analyzed to obtain activation free energy changes of -329, -195 and -221
cal/mole, respectively, for rate increases associated with time-specific
irradiation of the crystalline substrates prior to dissolution and
incorporation in the reaction solutions. These energies, presumably, correspond
to conformational or vibrational changes in the reactants or the activated
complex. For the lactic dehydrogenase / pyruvate reaction, it is estimated that
on the order of 10% of the irradiation energy (546 nm, 400 footcandles for 5
seconds) would be required to produce the observed reaction rate increase if a
presumed photoproduct is consumed stoichiometrically with the pyruvate
substrate. These findings are consistent with the proposition that the observed
reaction rate enhancement involves photoproducts derived from oscillatory
atmospheric gas reactions at the crystalline enzyme substrate surfaces rather
than photo-excitations of the substrate molecules, per se.

"In Japanese, you either type in the sound using roman characters i.e. A, B, C, etc. or you use a special type of keyboard where you push か, for example, and it will show the other 4 characters that begin with the 'k' sound. The phone will then see what sounds you're using and guess which kanji (the characters from Chinese) you want to use. You can scroll through them.

In Chinese, you type in pinyin which is the phonetic sounds Chinese uses. The phone will then guess which characters you want and you will choose. Now, phones will let you 'cheat' by only typing the first letters of the pinyin (sounds). For example, instead of typing 'beijing' to get 北京, you can just type 'bj' and 北京, among other things, will appear. 

Both systems are pretty easy to use. Chinese doesn't have phonetic characters like Japanese does, so you have to use pinyin. Japanese doesn't require using roman characters but many people (especially foreigners) do. 

Also, there are not millions of characters. I think I remember reading that Japanese has somewhere around 60,000 most of which are unrecognizable by almost everyone. Chinese probably has the same or double if you count both their traditional and simplified forms. In any case, they're far short of a million. 

Edit: Apparently Taiwan uses a special phonetic system called Zhuyin or Bopomofo, but I've never seen it anywhere in mainland China. I'd be willing to bet that nobody I know here in China would recognize it. Sorry to have inflamed so many delicate, Taiwanese sensitivities. If we're really going to get picky, we're talking about 普通话, so I'm going to base my information around what 北京 does. What Beijing does is not use Zhuyin."	0
"Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is the creation of new blood vessels in the choroid layer of the eye. Choroidal neovascularization is a common cause of neovascular degenerative maculopathy (i.e. 'wet' macular degeneration) commonly exacerbated by extreme myopia, malignant myopic degeneration, or age-related developments.

Causes
CNV can occur rapidly in individuals with defects in Bruch's membrane, the innermost layer of the choroid. It is also associated with excessive amounts of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). As well as in wet macular degeneration, CNV can also occur frequently with the rare genetic disease pseudoxanthoma elasticum and rarely with the more common optic disc drusen.  CNV has also been associated with extreme myopia or malignant myopic degeneration, where in choroidal neovascularization occurs primarily in the presence of cracks within the retinal (specifically) macular tissue known as lacquer cracks.

Symptoms
CNV can create a sudden deterioration of central vision, noticeable within a few weeks. Other symptoms which can occur include color disturbances, and metamorphopsia (distortions in which straight lines appear wavy). Hemorrhaging of the new blood vessels can accelerate the onset of symptoms of CNV. CNV may also include the feeling of pressure behind your eye.

Using modern optical coherence tomography devices, it is possible to detect non-exudative neovascular membranes, that are typically asymptomatic.

Identification
CNV can be detected by using a type of perimetry called preferential hyperacuity perimetry. On the basis of fluorescein angiography, CNV may be described as classic or occult. Two other tests that help identify the condition include indocyanine green angiography and optical coherence tomography.

Treatment
CNV is conventionally treated with intravitreal injections of angiogenesis inhibitors (also known as ""anti-VEGF"" drugs) to control neovascularization and reduce the area of fluid below the retinal pigment epithelium.  Angiogenesis inhibitors include pegaptanib, ranibizumab and bevacizumab (known by a variety of trade names, such as Macugen, Avastin or Lucentis). These inhibitors slow or stop the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis), typically by binding to or deactivating the transmission of vascular endothelial growth factor ('VEGF'), a signal protein produced by cells to stimulate formation of new blood vessels. The effectiveness of angiogenesis inhibitors has been shown to significantly improve visual prognosis with CNV, the recurrence rate for these neovascular areas remains high.

CNV may also be treated with photodynamic therapy (PDT) coupled with a photosensitive drug such as verteporfin (Visudyne). The drug is given intravenously. It is then activated in the eye by a laser light. The drug destroys the new blood vessels, and prevents any new vessels forming by forming thrombi. A Cochrane Review published in 2016 found that people with severe myopia (short-sightedness or near-sightedness) may benefit from being given anti-VEGF treatment.

The house was built in 1660 by the wealthy merchant Johannes van den Bosch, who had been born and raised on Texel island but moved to Amsterdam where he became rich as a shipowner.  The building is located at Noordmarkt 10-12 (Noordermarkt), near the southern end of the Binnenstad district.   It has since then changed hands several times between private owners until it was bought by the city council in 1928.    In 1953 the municipality decided that the property should be restored according to its original design from the 17th century.     After restoration work ended in 1956,  the house opened again as museum in 1957.   Since 1974  it houses the Rijksmuseum's collection of paintings by Dutch masters such as Rembrandt, Vermeer or Frans Hals.   On 1 January 2007 this part of the Rijksmuseum closed down because of renovations which will last till 2013.	1
"Good [previous answer](_URL_0_) via /u/AriGold317:

 >  ""There is an accurate perception that boys develop the fine motor skills necessary to hold a pen or pencil as much as six years later than girls. And then for boys to make correctly shaped symbols in specific horizontal alignment is even more difficult. It seems that boys develop the larger muscle mass for upper body strength before their brains can precisely control the movements of the smaller muscles in the wrists and fingers. There is also scientific analysis demonstrating that a boy’s brain develops many of the abilities for handwriting much later than a girl’s brain. A group that promotes separate schools for boys and girls, National Assoc. for Single Sex Public Education cites research by Harriet Hanlon, Robert Thatcher and Marvin Cline that details the differences in boy and girl brain development. Clearly, then, there are some measurable differences in muscle growth and brain development that result in the broad, general perception that a large percentage of boys are not capable of even average handwriting skills until a few years later than the early grades at school."	0

"This article presents an interesting idea on how we can use adversarially trained networks to generate features which could be used later when solving other classification related problems.  The authors present some experimental evidence supporting their claims but I think they should provide more details about these experiments so it would make sense why BiGANs perform better than competing methods. 
I also feel like there needs to be additional discussion regarding the computational complexity involved since training BiGANs involves optimizing two different objective functions at once. 

Overall though it's still worth reading because its novelty makes me believe there's potential here! Strengths:

"Buffalo Springs National Reserve is a protected area in the Isiolo County in northern Kenya.

Organization
The reserve was established in 1948 as part of the Samburu - Isiolo Game Reserve, and the present boundaries were established in 1985. The reserve is managed by the Isiolo County Council.
Most operators of Kenyan safaris offer a visit to the reserve, which has several Safari Lodges and safari camps.

Location
The Buffalo Springs National Reserve is south of the Samburu National Reserve, which lies on the other side of the Ewaso Ngiro river. It is named after an oasis of clear water at its western end.
The reserve has an area of , and is at an altitude of between  and  above sea level.
It is a gently rolling lowland plain of old lava flows and volcanic soils of olivine basalt. The main feature is the Champagne Ride in the southeast, an ancient lava-terrace.
The climate is hot, dry and semi-arid.

Flora
There is a narrow band of riverine forest along the Ewaso Ngiro which includes Tana River Poplar, Doum Palm and magnificent specimens of Acacia elatior.
Vegetation includes acacia tortilis woodland and large stretches of bushland dominated by Commiphora.
In some areas lava rock is exposed, with scattered grass and shrubs.
Other parts have alkaline grasslands with occasional springs and swamps. 
Here and there the ""Desert Rose"" (Adenium obesum) is found in the scrub, with bright pink blooms. 
The Salvadora persica (tooth-brush tree) shrub provides food to elephants, and its twigs are used as toothbrushes by the nomadic Samburu people.

Fauna
Wildlife include Grant's zebra and the endangered Grevy's Zebra. Other species of mammal include reticulated giraffe, the African bush elephant, oryx, gerenuk, African buffalo, lion, leopard, cheetah and hyena. Over 365 species of bird have been recorded in the reserve. The river is home to hippopotamuses and crocodiles. Somali ostriches are widespread within the national reserve. It is larger than the Masai ostrich's and is distinctive for their indigo legs and neck.

We report on an experiment to measure decoherence in a quantronium qubit using the cavity bifurcation amplifier (CBA). The CBA is used as a dispersive readout device for the quantronium, and we show that it can be operated at high bandwidths without significant back-action noise or added phase noise. We demonstrate measurement times up to 1 ms per data point while maintaining quantum-limited sensitivity. This allows us to perform measurements over many relaxation cycles of the system, which are necessary to extract information about its dynamics. In addition, we use this technique to study the effect of different environmental conditions on the coherence time of our system. Our results indicate that the CBA has great potential for future experiments studying open quantum systems. Quantum mechanics predicts that macroscopic objects such as atoms will exhibit wave-like behavior when they interact with light fields. However, these predictions have not been experimentally verified because measuring the properties of individual particles requires extremely sensitive detectors. Here, we present a new method for detecting single photons based on a nonlinear optical process known as parametric down-conversion. Using this approach, we detect single photons emitted by a trapped atom interacting with a laser field inside a high-finesse optical cavity. By coupling the output of the cavity into a second cavity containing a nonlinear crystal, we generate pairs of entangled photons whose frequencies differ by twice the frequency of the pump beam. These photon pairs are then detected simultaneously by two silicon avalanche photodiodes operating in Geiger mode.	1
" Loop the yarn around the pointer and middle fingers of your left hand. Stick your hook through the circle, hooking the working end of your yarn with the hook and then pulling it back through the center of the circle. This will give you one loop on your crochet hook.
, This will form the very center of the circle you are crocheting.









If you are following a pattern you may need to make a different number of chains to start. This will change the number of stitches you make in further steps but will not change the general technique.

, Insert the hook into the loop of the first chain you made. Once through, hook the working end of the yarn onto the hook and then pull it back through the loop and also through the loop that was on your hook.Now the piece is formed into a circle and you have one loop on your hook.








, Be sure that you are going through the very center and not one of the stitches you made.








, To ""yarn over"" means that you need to hook the working end of your yarn onto your hook. Then twist your hook slightly, so that the yarn stays hooked on.







, Two loops should be on the hook after you complete this step.








, This is the finishing step of the basic stitch called a ""Single Crochet"".








, In all you will make eight single crochet stitches around forming a tiny circle for the beginning of your project.








, This will be the first step in creating a connection between the end of the last round to the beginning of it and setting the stage to start another.







, Two loops should now be on the hook.








, This the finishing step of the single crochet stitch which joins everything into a circle. This stitch is also the first single crochet of the next round. (Stitch 1 of 16 total.)








, Now continue around the circle by making two single crochet stitches in each single crochet stitch of the first ring. Doing this is called an ""increase"". This means that there will be 16 stitches when you complete the round. Please count them.









Doing two stitches in each one stitch from the previous round is how we ""increase"" the size of the circle we are making.

, However, this time you will put only one single crochet in the first stitch but then put two single crochet stitches in the next stitch. Do this ""increase"" in every other stitch of the previous round.Repeat this to the end of the round.








, Make one single crochet in the first stitch, then make two single crochets in the next stitch. On the next round do two stitches in every third stitch, then two stitches in every fourth stitch and so on.









See a pattern developing? To keep increasing, put two stitches in the n-th stitch where n is the number of the round you're currently working on. For instance, if you are working on the fourth round, put two stitches in every fourth stitch as you work your way around. You may loop a shot piece of contrasting colored yarn through each round if you wish, to help know which row you are on.

, This is called ""Tie-ing off the end"". Once the yarn is tied off, sew or ""weave"" in the ends. Some patterns use the word ""weave"". To sew or weave in the ends, use a Yarn Needle. Fold the yarn end over the Yarn Needle forming a small tight loop. Slide the yarn needle out of the loop, then insert this tight loop into the eye of the Yarn Needle. Push it through far enough that you can grasp the loop and pull the yarn all the way through the eye. Gently weave the needle tip under and over stitches on the back of your work where it will not show. Do this for a distance of 7 to 8 stitches. Now turn around and alternate. Go over the stitches you previously went under and visa-versa. Now turn it around and do it a third time, this will make the ""tail"" or ""yarn-end"" stay put for many years. Remember to sew in both ""tails"" on the outside edge and in the very center.

"The authors present an interesting approach to variable computation using recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The main idea is that RNNs can be used as computational graphs, where each node has some internal state and performs computations on inputs from other nodes.
This work shows how this concept of graph-based computing can be applied to different problems such as:  sequence generation; language modeling with word embeddings; image classification This article provides useful insights into applying RNNs to these tasks by showing how they are related through their common underlying structure.  I think it would have been helpful if there were more examples shown throughout the text so readers could better understand what was being discussed. Overall though, it's well written and easy-to-read. It also includes many references which provide additional information about topics covered here. 
I recommend reading this article!"	1
" There is no magic number or time at which a person is ready for dating. It's dependent on who you are, how mature you feel and what your parents think about it too. Indeed, it's a combination of factors. At this point, don't feel bad if you don't actually feel like dating yet––that's okay to, you can have friends instead of dates too and nobody will think any the worse of you for it.


Take a little time to better understand your own motivations for having a boyfriend or going out. How big a factor is each of the following for you: wanting friendship/companionship and someone to hang out with; wanting to have someone else interested in your well-being and listen to your worries and joys; wanting affection (hugs, touch and nonphysical affection, romance, etc.); wanting to be accepted and cool and not seen as a loner by schoolmates? Which of these are your main motivators? The better you understand your own needs and motives, the better your decisions and choices will be about whether to ask a boy out, and if so, who to ask, and how to do it.
Taking the time to introspect and understand yourself better is a lifelong process important for adults as well as for middle school students.;
, If they don't think that dating boys is appropriate right now, they mean it and they have good reasons. Listen to them and just find friends instead. There's plenty of time for love later.


If you're parents are cautious but open to the possibility, explain how responsible you'd be if you went on a date, such as meeting curfew times, letting them know where you are going and being reachable by phone at all times.

, Ask them what they think about dating and how comfortable they feel about it. While you don't need to agree with what they say or think, it can be helpful to gauge their feelings and get ideas to form your own thoughts.

, Once you're happy that you're ready to date, try getting to know this boy better.

, He might not turn out to be the kind of person you first thought. It makes good, common sense to get to know him a little before asking him out. Fortunately, there are plenty of ways you can use to get to know this great person somewhat better.

, Make it a group thing. Get your friends and his friends to mingle at recess, lunch and after school. Make it all seem most casual, and just hang about chatting to everyone, including him.


Make friends with him and his friends. It will make him feel closer to you without realizing just yet what your real intentions are. This gives you the space to study him close up and kindly.

, Have casual conversations with him about school, sport, your uniforms, school rules, anything really that is simple, relevant and easy to chat about.


Find out what interests him and let him know just a little about what interests you.
Here are some conversation starters: ""Want some gum?"" ""Hey, do you have any gum?"" ""Okay, no more projects on cells. Mine looked like it came out of a horror movie!"" or ""Random Question: are you a morning or night person?"". If you are in different years/grades, ask him what he thinks you'd like next year.
Don't chew his head off with ""me, me, me"" talk though. Instead, make the aim to learn as much as you can about him. He'll ask you enough things in time.

, Give him little gifts now and then, such as chocolates. But be sure to give them to his and your friends at the same time. You're trying to prove you're a generous lassie, not someone focused only on him––that comes shortly. For now, show him what a great spirit of generosity you are.

, Send a friend request and bond online. Send casual messages, jokes, funny pictures and nice sayings. Keep it light and friendly and include your other friends initially so that he looks like he's just one among many recipients of your online banter. As time goes on, you may grow to feel comfortable just chatting or messaging him.

, He doesn't want to know what you're doing every five seconds and he certainly doesn't want to have answer to you about what he's doing every five seconds. Instead, just get to know his schedule, work around it with the occasional ""hello"", ""how's it going"" and ""wow, isn't funny how we keep bumping into each other?"" moments.


If you're online, take the chance to now and then send something with a ""when I saw this, it made me think of you, 'coz I know you like the LOL cat/etc. pictures"".

, Do you want him to be your boyfriend? Before you ask him out, be sure he's the one. Before you decide that you're in love, know what your own feelings are. Make a list of the negatives and positives about him, and then decide.

, At least have inkling that this guy has grown fond of you and is somewhat into you. Signs include him breaking the touch barrier, lingering gazes, fond nicknames, making excuses to be near you, texting or messaging you a lot, blowing you kisses and generally being sweet to you. In some cases, he might be a little more brash and teasing toward you, because he feels comfortable around you. If you've gotten the impression that he's keen, it might be time. Ask him when you feel right and comfortable!

, If so, flirt a little, make eye contact more often and pass a few sweet notes to him in class. Make it clear that you're keen on him.

, He's yours for the taking if you've noted the signs correctly and feel you know him well enough by now.


Rehearse asking. If it helps you to gain confidence, practice beforehand. First, write down what you want to say. Then, practice in the mirror. Look at your body language and facial expressions. Practice until you feel confident.

, This is especially important at the middle school and junior school levels. This isn't about determining your love match for life; it's about gaining a fun and carefree romantic friendship and the main thing is that you both feel comfortable with one another.


Say something like, ""Want to go for a slurpee over lunch break?"". This is perfect. Make sure his lunches are free first.
Or, casually ask ""So do you have band/yearbook/practice, etc. today? Mind if I come too"".
Or, ""Hey, would you like to come with me to the movies/park/skate rink, etc. this weekend?""
If asking him out over text message, say something like: ""My friends think we should get married. Spring wedding sound good?"" Expect a ""lol"" as a response. Then after he responds, say something like, ""Yeah, but I really do like you."" Do try to use full words as often as possible; text messages can look really stupid if you use text language (u for you, r for are).

, Realize that he may need time to process your request to get together, hang out or go on a date, and that's fine. Let him know it's fine and that he can get back to you.


If he says no, that's all right. He's probably embarrassed, or he hasn't made up his mind. Be understanding, and don't become defensive or act hurt. Never stall or make excuses. But at least he knows you like him and he might start looking at you in a different way.
If he says yes, say ""great"" and start planning your date, make sure you pay, unless he insists. Some guys love it when the girl pays, it makes them feel loved, others feel guilty and feel like their being given sympathy.

, Bite your head off? No he will either say yes, no or I'll think about it (if the later, don't let him leave you hanging indefinitely; move on). Only ask if you really like him! Don't do it if you're just making it up! If he gives you something, try to give him something back the next day.

, He may be with his friends more often than when he is with you. This is normal, and part of a healthy relationship!

, If he sees that you care and want to see him more often, he may become more committed to the relationship. (Try to have a few activities in mind to do together, like playing video games, baking brownies, watching a favorite show or movie, shooting hoops at the nearest basketball goal, etc.)

, Depending on the sort of guy he is, if he comes around to your house, find a comfy spot and lean in. Boys love kissing! However, if you aren't comfortable, don't force yourself.

, You want to keep in touch with him, but not 24/7! He might think you're a nag, or that you don't trust him. Text him once or twice a day, if he responds, YAY! But you can't expect him to. Also, if you see him in the hallway just say hi. If he stops you to talk, stay there and have a short conversation or tell him you'll talk to him at lunch.

, If he is mean, cruel, or disinterested, just move on. He may be cute or cool, but it's just not worth being mistreated to try to pursue him. Pick someone new to like. Always remember that boys don't control your happiness.

"  Great part of the interest in complex networks has been motivated by the
presence of structured, frequently non-uniform, connectivity. Because diverse
connectivity patterns tend to result in distinct network dynamics, and also
because they provide the means to identify and classify several types of
complex networks, it becomes important to obtain meaningful measurements of the
local network topology. In addition to traditional features such as the node
degree, clustering coefficient and shortest path, motifs have been introduced
in the literature in order to provide complementary description of the networks
connectivity. The current work proposes a new type of motifs, namely chains of
nodes, namely sequences of connected nodes with degree two. These chains have
been subdivided into cords, tails, rings and handles, depending on the type of
their extremities (e.g. open or connected). A theoretical analysis of the
density of such motifs in random and scale free networks is described, and an
algorithm for identifying those motifs in general networks is presented. The
potential of considering chains for network characterization has been
illustrated with respect to five categories of real-world networks including 16
cases. Several interesting findings were obtained, including the fact that
several chains were observed in the real-world networks, especially the WWW,
books, and power-grid. The possibility of chains resulting from incompletely
sampled networks is also investigated.

" Federal law requires the college to provide you with a list of required textbooks once you register for classes, so you should be able to find out which books you need well in advance from either the registrar or your professors. You should not need to rely on the campus bookstore to tell you.;
, You might be able to find the occasional good deal at your campus bookstore, but in the vast majority of cases, you can find the books you need for a much lower cost somewhere online.Check out websites like BIG WORDS.com and Campus books.com, both of which direct you toward textbook sellers offering the lowest prices.
Also check out websites that allow users to sell their own used and new copies of a book, like Amazon or Half.com.

, For many textbooks, you can buy an old edition at a lower price without facing too much difficulty.


You might want to check with your professors before doing this, however, in the rare instance that there is a significant change in the new edition that you will need access to in order to survive the class.

, Renting your textbooks will not guarantee a lower price tag, but oftentimes, the price to rent a book will be cheaper than the price to buy. Look into both options and determine which will work best for any particular book.


You can check your campus bookstore for renting opportunities, but there are also online sources, including Chegg, BookRenter.com, CampusBookRental.com, and ValoreBooks.

, If you really want to pinch pennies, you can check for coupons that allow you to save money on textbooks bought online. These coupons will rarely be specific to the publisher, but you might be able to find coupons for various online stores.

, If you know a friend who needs to buy some of the same textbooks, consider splitting the cost in half with that friend and sharing the book.

, Upperclassmen who are done with a textbook for good will occasionally sell it, and the cost is usually pretty cheap since they tend to be more interested in making whatever they can on the book.

, As long as the international edition is printed in the same language, this can be a viable option. Research carefully, however, since international editions can go either way in terms of cost.


Check the cost of shipping, as well, since shipping costs on international editions can sometimes cause the overall price of the book to shoot up.

, Even if you plan to do most of your work on your computer, you still need a range of basic writing utensils for class time and study time.


Buy blue or black ball-point pens and pencils for taking notes and filling in exam papers.
Get highlighters to help you study.
Invest in a couple of permanent markers and a bottle of white-out., Folders and notebooks are essentials, but there are a few other supplies that could come in handy that may not be quite as obvious.


Consider buying a three-ring binder and a hole punch to help you stay organized, as well as subject dividers and loose-leaf paper.
Buy a book bag or messenger bag that you can carry from class to class.

, The desk in your dorm room will need to hold a large number of supplies and papers, so buy tools and supplies that can help you keep everything in order—including your sanity.


Consider buying:
Sticky notes
Personal organizer or calender
Dictionary and thesaurus
Calculator
Rubber bands, a ruler, scissors, a stapler and staples, thumbtacks, and tape

, If you do not have one already, you should really consider buying a computer. Most of your classes will require you to type and print papers, and a computer can also help you with research and entertainment.


Aside from a computer, check into buying:

Printer
Printer paper
Ink cartridges
Flash drive


Find out if your campus has computer labs equipped with printers. If so, you might be able to skip the printer and save yourself the cost.
Protect your tech. Buy surge protectors to protect your computer from any unexpected electrical surges. You can also consider buying an external hard drive so you can periodically back up the contents of your hard drive.

, Most dorm rooms are equipped with extra-long twin beds, so when you buy comforters and sheets, you should make sure that the size of the bedding you buy will match the size of the bed you will have.


You will need pillows and pillowcases, bed sheets, a blanket, and a quilt or comforter.
Also consider buying a mattress pad to make your bed more comfortable.

, Many dorm rooms are equipped with some form of lighting and mirrors, but it usually will not hurt to buy a few of these yourself.


If your dorm does not come with one, buy a full-length mirror.
Consider buying a desk lamp and floor lamp to supplement the overhead lighting installed in the room.

, An alarm clock is an absolute must, unless you have an alarm on your cell phone that you rely on. Even if you do use your cell phone alarm, having a backup alarm clock can still be a good idea.


You should also buy supplies that can help you fall asleep faster so that you can wake up well-rested. These may include earplugs and an eye mask.

, Odds are, you can just bring the same clothes you wore throughout your high school years. There might be a few instances in which you will want or need to buy new clothes.


Prepare for bad weather. Have a raincoat, rain boots, umbrella, and snow boots, as needed.
If the climate you are moving to differs from the climate back home, buy clothes that are more suited toward the climate you'll be heading to.

, Some items you need to bring with you will not stay out once you get to campus, so you should buy a few storage bins to help you store any excess materials until you need them.


Also consider buying temporary racks and shelving to store shoes, books, and other belongings that you need to access easily.

, While this is not a necessity, you should consider buying things to decorate your walls and door. This is the room you will be living in for the majority of the year, after all, so you'll want it to be comfortable for you.


Options worth considering include:

Bulletin board
Posters
Dry-erase message board and pens for your door



, If you have never owned your own suitcases, now is the time to buy a set. Purchasing your luggage in sets is recommended over purchasing it piece by piece, since a set will usually provide you with the best deal for your money.

, You will need a large bath towel and small washcloth, at minimum, but there are also a few other shower-related items you should look into buying.Purchase sandals or shower shoes to protect your feet from the bacteria left behind in communal showers.
Buy shampoo, conditioner, and body wash.
If your room has its own bathroom, buy hand towels, a bath mat, and toilet paper.
Bring a shower caddy to store your soaps and other supplies.

, As a general guideline, any product or tool you use at home should be brought with you to college. If you were using your parents' supplies at home, you need to buy your own, now.


Buy a hair dryer, flat iron, brush, comb, and curling iron, as needed.
Also consider buying a razor and shaving cream to take care of facial and/or body hair.

, As with hair care products, any skin care product you use at home will also need to be purchased for college.


Protect your skin with moisturizing lotion and sunscreen.
Keep your teeth clean with your own toothbrush and toothpaste.
Buy a new tube of lip balm.
Keep body odor in check with deodorant.

, A first aid kit is a good idea for any college kid. You can buy a commercially-prepared first aid kit or buy the supplies separately.


Supplies worth including are:

Rubbing alcohol
Antibacterial ointment
Adhesive bandages
Hydrogen peroxide
Thermometer



, Aside from a first aid kit, there are a few other items you should consider having in case you get sick or otherwise feel less than your best.


A few items worth buying include:

Over-the-counter headache medicine, cold medicine, and allergy medicine
Prescription medications
Cough drops
Eye drops



, In many cases, you will only need to worry about cleaning your bedroom or dorm room. In some cases, however, you might also be responsible for the dorm hallways, bathroom, or kitchen area, in which instance, you will need to buy cleaning supplies for these areas, as well.

, A vacuum cleaner, broom, and mop should all be on your college shopping list.


Invest in a mini-vacuum cleaner, especially if you are only in charge of a small space like your dorm room.

, You will almost always need to wash your own clothes. Stock up on laundry detergent and invest in a hamper.


Buy a collapsible hamper to save room.
Purchase fabric softener in either liquid or dry sheet form.

, Disinfectant wipes are advisable, regardless of how much you will be expected to clean. Having disinfectant wipes and sprays can help reduce the spread of germs, which is very important in a compact space like a dorm room.


Also bring along dish soap and glass cleaner, as well as clean rags that can be used for scrubbing.

, Even the most studious college student will need to unwind every now and then. Now is as good an excuse as any to stock up on any CDs, DVDs, or Blu-rays you've had your eye on.


Skip the fancy sound systems, though, since you can get in trouble if you make too much noise and your neighbors file a complaint.
Also buy a small TV to watch your movies on.

, You might love your music, but that does not mean your roommate or your neighbors will love it as much as you do. Headphones are important, so if you do not own any, buy them now.


If you invest in noise-canceling headphones, you can also shield your ears from the music and sounds made by other people.

, If you enjoy reading, purchase a few books you can look forward to reading. Doing so can restore some of the joy of reading that might otherwise get lost amidst all the textbook work.

, Indoor and outdoor games can help you relieve stress and make friends, so if you do not have any games you can bring along with you to college, buy one or two now.


Board games and card games are a great, inexpensive option. You can also bring a video game console, but do so at your own risk, since this could be stolen if you leave your room unlocked and unattended.
Buy supplies for outdoor fun, too, like rollerblades, a frisbee, or a basketball.

, Many colleges have restrictions regarding the types of cooking instruments you are allowed to keep in your dorm room. Review these restrictions before making any big purchases.


Items you should check on before buying include:

Coffee maker
Blender
Microwave
Small refrigerator



, Resealable plastic bins and plastic bags are important since they allow you to store leftovers and make your food supply last longer.


Make sure that your plastic bins are microwave-safe.

, Forks, knives, and spoons are the absolute essentials you need to stock up on, so buy these supplies before you head off to college.


You should also consider buying a can opener, funnel, and any cooking utensils (like whisks and mixing spoons) you might need if you plan to prepare your own food.
Cooking supplies also include baking pans, saucepans, and frying pans.

, You will also need plates, bowls, cups, and mugs when you head off to college.


Make sure that your dishes are microwave-safe.

"The authors present an interesting idea in using ML techniques to improve automated theorem provers.  They provide some preliminary experiments with several different types of ML algorithms but do not yet have any significant conclusions about which ones are most promising.
I think it would help if they could explain how exactly HolStep is useful beyond just being another data source for researchers interested in improving automated theorem proving systems.   What does having access to large amounts of human-written proof fragments allow you to learn? How will this knowledge benefit other areas besides theorem proving?  For example, what insights might one gain by studying why humans choose certain tactics over others when trying to prove theorems? This information may even lead to better ways of teaching logic courses! I am curious as well whether there were any unexpected difficulties encountered while collecting the data..."	1
"The authors present their work very clearly.  They have done extensive research into how they can generate data that is useful when evaluating distributed representations (word vectors). I think it would make sense if there was some discussion about why these types of evaluations are important - what do you hope will come from them? What does your proposed method add over existing methods?  How could other researchers use or build upon your approach?
I also wonder whether it's possible to get more information about the Wikipedia pages being clustered together by looking at the cluster labels themselves... For example, one might expect that all articles under the label ""Music"" should share certain properties such as genre etc., but perhaps not so much those labeled ""Science fiction novels"".... 
Finally,  I'm curious about how many different languages were included in the clustering process. 

Answer Yes"	1
"  Recent numerical simulations of binary black hole mergers show the
possibility of producing very large recoil velocities (> 3000 km/s). Kicks of
this magnitude should be sufficient to eject the final black hole from
virtually any galactic potential. This result has been seen as a potential
contradiction with observations of supermassive black holes residing in the
centers of most galaxies in the local universe. Using an extremely simplified
merger tree model, we show that, even in the limit of very large ejection
probability, after a small number of merger generations there should still be
an appreciable fraction (>50%) of galaxies with supermassive black holes today.
We go on to argue that the inclusion of more realistic physics ingredients in
the merger model should systematically increase this retention fraction,
helping to resolve a potential conflict between theory and observation. Lastly,
we develop a more realistic Monte Carlo model to confirm the qualitative
arguments and estimate occupation fractions as a function of the central
galactic velocity dispersion.

You may also be interested in:  Starting A Band In College How To Make Your Own Album Writing Songs Getting Into The Music Industry Making Money From Playing An Instrument Before we even think about putting together our own band there are several important steps we'll need to take before we actually hit the stage as professional musicians.   First off we're going to talk about what it's really like being part of a high school rock band - not everyone has been lucky enough to experience life inside such a group!  Then there's the matter of finding members who share similar interests...and musical abilities!
Next comes the difficult task of coming up with original music ideas....then finally recording those tunes onto tape using whatever equipment we've managed to acquire over time.  Finally once everything else seems to fall into place we'd better find somewhere suitable to perform these new compositions live while still maintaining a reasonable amount of privacy during rehearsals.  We'd love to hear any comments you'd care to leave below regarding this topic."	1
"Printer inks contain pigments that can be difficult to produce synthetically or extract from natural sources; whereas packaging materials often use dyes which are easier to make artificially (and thus cheaper). Pigmented inks also tend to last longer than dyes: they do not fade as quickly when exposed to light and/or air. Dye-based products may have an initial ""glow"" but will eventually discolour over time. The cost of producing pigmentary inks tends to outweigh their benefits compared with dye based alternatives. This does not mean that all pigmentary inks are more costly - some types such as carbon black are relatively inexpensive because it is produced on large scale industrial processes. It just means that most pigmentary inks are generally more expensive due to production costs. Printers need specialised equipment to print using pigmentary inks. In contrast, printing companies typically buy pre-made printed material rather than making them themselves"	1
"In this work, we introduce the higher order Schwarzian derivative (HOSD) to study chaotic behavior in dynamical systems. The HOSD is defined as the second-order differential operator with respect to time variable t acting on the first-order derivatives of the state variables x(t). We show that the HOSD can be used to construct new invariant sufficient conditions of chaos by using its properties such as non-negativity and monotonicity under some suitable assumptions. In addition, it also provides an alternative way to investigate the existence of periodic orbits in nonlinear autonomous systems. Finally, numerical examples are given to illustrate our results. Keywords: Dynamical systems; Chaos; Periodic orbit; Nonlinearity; Higher order Schwarzian derivative. 1 Introduction Let us consider the following nonautonomous ordinary differential equations (ODEs)
x = f(t; x; u), where f: R × Rn × Rm → Rn, (1.1) which describes many physical phenomena arising in engineering fields [1] . Here, t ∈ [0, T] denotes time; x ∈ Rn represents the state vector; and u ∈ Rm stands for control input or parameter vector. It should be noted that the function f may depend explicitly on both time t and control parameters u. For example, if one considers the motion of a particle moving along a straight line at constant speed v, then the position of the particle at any instant of time t is described by the equation x = vt + x0, where x0 is the initial position of the particle [2] .
The main goal of this article is to present a novel approach based on the higher order Schwarzian"	1
"This article presents a novel approach towards solving one of AI's long-standing problems - representing procedural knowledge using deep learning techniques.  It proposes Neural Equivalence Networks (NEN) -a network architecture capable of computing continuous semantic representations from symbolic inputs. NEN learns these representations through supervised training over pairs of equivalent input-output examples.
In order to train their models, authors use synthetic data generated via random sampling from distributions defined over various classes of symbolic expressions. They evaluate performance against several baselines including state-of-the-art approaches and show significant improvements across all metrics used. 
Overall I find it interesting enough to read further into. 

I would recommend publishing after addressing some minor issues listed below.  

1. Authors should provide more details about what exactly they mean when talking about ""symbolic"" expressions"	1
Can you provide more details on the configuration of the NCE training?	0
Females are usually more caring than males and have stronger maternal instincts. This is especially true among mammals where it has been shown that mothers bond with their offspring much tighter than fathers do.  In some cases like elephants or giraffes both parents share equally on raising young ones but this happens less often then not. Females also tend to be larger so they can carry heavier babies which makes them better suited as mother animals. Mothers are generally bigger because they need to produce milk for their children while fathers don't require any special nutrients from food sources other than protein (which all foods contain). The same goes for birds except there is no difference between male and female size since eggs weigh very little compared to mammal's weight. Because females are usually more caring  than males and have stronger parental instincts. They are also typically larger making them able to carry heavy babies. Some animals such as elephants or giraffe both parents share equally on rearing young ones	1
"The author has responded in detail to the comments made by Prof. Guseinov, which are published as an extended commentary on his original article entitled """"One-range addition theorems for coulomb interaction potential and its derivatives"""".  In this combined reply he shows that all the objections raised against him can be answered satisfactorily. He also presents some new results concerning the one-range addition theorem for the first derivative of the coulomb interaction potential. These results have been obtained using the same method used previously to derive the corresponding theorem for the second-order derivative. Finally, it is shown how these results may be applied to obtain accurate values of the energy levels of helium-like ions with nuclear charges Z = 1 - 6. This work was supported by the Australian Research Council under Grant No. DP0775560. The author thanks Dr. A. M. Aliev for useful discussions during the preparation of this manuscript."	1
", Measure your paper according to the following formulas:


Height = Height of gift bag + 2” + 1.25”
Width = Width of bag + depth of bag + width+ depth + 0.5”
If you see a fold in the paper, try to align the fold with one of the natural creases of the paper. If you don’t mind a fold in your bag, then you don’t have to worry about placement.

,, The wrong side should be facing you.

,
Measure the depth from the fold that you just made and fold.
Measure the width again and fold.
Measure the depth again and fold. You are creating the 4 sides of the bag. If you’ve done this correctly, you will have 0.5” left over for the seam of the bag.

,,, Make the piece 1” tall. You will place this under the rim of the bag to reinforce the paper.

, The top of the chipboard or cardstock should meet the top crease in the paper where you folded the top down.

, Since the bag is 2-ply, you will have to glue each layer of paper separately.

, Make sure that the cut edge of the panel aligns with the folded edge of the flap.

,


Fold the short sides inward and crease them.
Bring the top and bottom triangles together. This is exactly the way that you fold the sides when you are wrapping a gift.
Place glue around the diagonal sides of the triangles and glue the pieces together.

, The height should match the depth of the gift bag, and its width should match the width of the gift bag. Then, trim 0.25” from each side of the cardboard.

, This will hide the bottom seams and reinforce the bag.

, These holes will house the handles of the bag.

"The annual festival of trichambaram temple  (Trichambaram Utsavam) is a colourful event.

Govindha!, Govindha!
The fortnight-long festival begins on Kumbham 22 of Malayalam calendar (which generally falls on 6 March) every year with the kodiyettam (hoisting of a religious flag) and comes to an end on Meenam 6 (which generallay falls on 20 March) with Koodipiriyal (Ending of this festival). In between these dates, for 11 days, thitambu nriththam (a sort of dance with the deities of Krishna and Balarama) is held at Pookoth Nada (1 km from Trichambaram temple). On the last day, the devotees run from Trichambram temple to Mazhur temple shouting Govinda!, Govinda!.

Krishna Temple
A sacred place of the Vaishnava sect that predates the 10th century, the deity of the temple is Sree Krishna. The sculptures on the walls of the sanctum sanctorum are unique by themselves. The annual temple festival, usually held in March, is a colourful event.

Govindha, Govindha!
The procession on the final day of the festival starts from Taliparamba and proceeds to Mazhur village through the Chinmaya Mission Road.  The devotees shout Govinda, Govinda all the way and they carry lighted cloth torches in the procession.  This procession is essentially a fast paced one and all the participants have to run during the ceremony.  Even the policemen on duty inside the procession have no other option as the rituals insist a running ceremony.

"Because of their high volume and pressure release, which causes rapid expansion in air molecules around them. This is called adiabatic decompression (or sometimes sonic boom). The sound can be heard from miles away because it travels faster than any other medium except light waves.  Balloons are filled with helium or hydrogen gas at very high pressures that cause this effect to occur more quickly upon balloon deflation. When you blow up your balloon using an inflator pump, you're actually compressing the gases inside until they're under enough pressure so as not to expand too rapidly on their own. If you let go before it's fully expanded, you'll hear a loud ""pop"" like you've just blown out one of these balloons. Because of its higher density compared to air, water also makes louder pops if released suddenly into open space. Air has lower density but still expands rapidly after being compressed by a sudden change in atmospheric pressure"	1
They have developed preferences based on what tastes good, not necessarily what's healthy or nutritious.  They may also develop food sensitivities that cause them discomfort when eating certain foods (e.g., dairy products).

"This work proposes a new approach towards optimizing non--convex functions using smoothing techniques similar to those used in Continuation Methods.  This method has been shown effective at solving several hard machine learning problems including image classification, speech recognition etc., but also other applications like reinforcement learning where one needs to solve high dimensional MDPs. 
In particular, authors propose to use a sequence of simpler surrogate functions instead of directly optimizing over the true objective function. They provide theoretical guarantees showing how their proposed algorithm converges to optimal solutions under certain conditions. Finally they demonstrate empirically superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines across different datasets. 

Overall I think it's very interesting research and well written article! Strengths: 
1. It provides both theory and empirical results supporting its claims"	1

"Religion is defined by Webster’s dictionary as:  “Belief in supernatural beings; worship offered them”.  This definition does not take into account how these beliefs were formed nor what they mean for their followers.   In order to understand this topic better we need to look at its history.    History shows us that there was no single moment when man began believing in gods but rather that belief developed gradually throughout time with each culture developing its own unique way of expressing itself.   There seems little doubt however that the earliest known form of organized religion dates back some 10 000 years ago during the Neolithic period (the stone age) where hunter-gatherers living along the banks...

, which means “the knowledge of God"").   It is believed that he lived around 600 BC and founded his teachings based upon the Vedas - sacred texts written down thousands of years earlier.   He taught that every person could achieve liberation from suffering by following certain spiritual practices such as meditation and yoga.   His teaching spread quickly across India and influenced other cultures including Chinese Taoist philosophy and Japanese Zen Buddhism.   Today most Hindus consider him to be a god-like figure who represents love, compassion, forgiveness and wisdom.   Hindu scriptures state that after Gautama Buddha attained enlightenment, he became aware of the existence of another teacher named Āgama Metteyya whose teachings would eventually become Jainism.   According to legend, Gautama Buddha met Āgama Metteyyia before becoming fully awakened himself.   However, while both teachers preached similar philosophies, Gautama Buddha rejected Āgama Mettey's teachings because he felt that they did not go far enough.   For example, Āgama Mettey' s teachings stated that even animals should be treated kindly whereas Gautama Buddha said that only humans needed to be loved unconditionally.   Although Buddhism originated in India,..."	1
The authors present their work on Unrolled GANs very clearly.  The introduction explains why they are interested in solving problems associated with GANs as well as giving background information about them.   They also explain that there have been other attempts at addressing these issues before introducing their own approach.    Their experiments demonstrate convincingly that their proposed solution works better than previous approaches for several different types of datasets including MNIST digits, CelebA faces,  LSUN bedrooms  and Cityscapes images.     In particular it seems like the new approach helps prevent overfitting when dealing with large numbers of parameters such as those used in Recurrent Neural Network based models.      There were only two minor points I would raise regarding the presentation of results - one was related to Figure 3 where some values seemed off compared to others; another concerned Table 1 , where the number of epochs needed to reach convergence varied slightly from experiment to experiment even though all runs had identical hyperparameters.        Overall it's clear that this article makes important contributions towards improving our understanding of GANs	1
"The authors present an interesting approach to generate images from text descriptions using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The proposed method is able to learn how to translate natural language into image features and then use these learned feature representations as input of GANs, which can be trained in parallel on multiple GPUs.
However, I have some concerns about this work. 

First, it seems that there are no experiments conducted with human subjects or any other kind of user studies performed by the authors themselves.  This makes me wonder if their results would actually look like what they show us here? Second,  although the authors claim that their model has been tested against several state-of-the-art methods such as VAE-GAN, WGAN etc., we don't see much details provided regarding those comparisons.

"This paper compares several strategies for guessing a short list of vocabulary for the target language in neural machine translation. The primary findings are that word alignment dictionaries work better than a variety of other techniques.

My take on this paper is that to have a significant impact, it needs to make the case for why one might want vocabulary rather than characters or sub word units like BPE. I think there are likely many very good reasons to do this that could be argued for (synthesize morphology, deal with transliteration, etc), but most of these would suggest some particular models and experiments, which are of course not in this paper. As it is, I think this paper is a useful but minor contribution that shows that word alignment is a good way of getting short lists, but it does not strongly make the case that we should abandon work in other directions.

Minor comments:
In addition to the SVM approach for modeling vocabulary, the discriminative word lexicon of Mauser et al. (2009) and the neural version of Ha et al. (2014) are also worth mentioning.

It would be useful to know what the coverage rate of the actual full vocabulary would be (rather than the 100k “full vocabulary”). Since presumably this technique could be used to work with much larger vocabularies.

When reducing the vocabulary size for training, the Mi et al. (2016) technique of taking the union of all the vocabularies in a mini batch seems like a rather strange objective. If the vocabulary of a single sentence is used, the probabilistic semantics of the translation model can still be preserved since p(e | f, vocab(f)) = p(e | f) if p(vocab(f) | f) = 1, i.e., is deterministic, which it is here. Whereas the objective is no longer a sensible probability model in the mini batch vocabulary case. Thus, while it may be a bit more difficult to implement, it seems like it would at least be a sensible comparison to make."	0
"Hydroponics (from Greek ""hydro"" meaning water + ""pnōs"" meaning work), also known as aquaponics, aeroponics, soil-less farming, liquid culture systems, nutrient film technique, etc.  -  is an agricultural method which uses mineral nutrients dissolved in water instead of using soil to nourish plants.   This system can be used indoors and/or outdoors depending on what type of hydroponic equipment you're going to use.    The advantages of this kind of agriculture are:    1.) It doesn't require much space; 2.) You do not need fertile land; 3.) Water consumption is lower than traditional farming; 4.) There is no risk of pesticide contamination because there isn't dirt involved.     In order to start hydroponic gardening:     Buy hydroponic supplies such as:   * A pump;   * Pots/tubes;   * Nutrient solution;   * Light fixtures;   * Air stones;   * Fertilizer;   * pH tester;   * Irrigation controller;   * Tray/basket;   * Styrofoam;   * Plastic netting;   * Sprouting tray;   * Seed trays;   * Soaker hose;   * Drip irrigation kit;   * Aerating stone;   * Filtered air pump;   * Ventilation fan;   *..."	1
"Because that's how the universe works.

To really understand this, you have to understand that when you ""sit still"" you're still moving. You're moving through time. How do you know? Because if you sit still for a minute you reach one minute into the future of when you started sitting there. If you weren't moving through time you would just stay at that moment forever. That doesn't happen, so you must be moving through time.

Now, let's say you and I are sitting still together and you decide to stop sitting still. You start moving forward. You are now moving a little bit in space, but you're still moving in time as well. Here's where it gets weird, and if you don't want to get into some mildly complicated math you have to take my word for it: you're always moving the same total speed. That speed is the speed of light. When you were sitting still you were moving at the speed of light through time. Once you started moving, some of your speed went into moving forward, which left a little less for moving through time. This means that while I'm still going one minute into the future every minute, you're not—if I look at your watch when my watch says its been one minute, then your watch will say it hasn't been quite a minute. Now, the speed of light is *really* fast, and you probably aren't moving forward very quickly, so you only needed a little of your speed to move forward and most of it is still going through time, so our watches are probably still pretty close. As you start going forward faster, though, more of your speed is going into that so you have less to move through time and our watches start to be very different. So, what happens as you get close to moving forward at the speed of light? You get close to not moving *at all* through time. My watch says a minute, an hour, a day, a year have gone by while yours says it's been less than a second. If you ever actually got to the speed of light (you can't), then you would not be moving through time at all and I would see your watch just stopped as you flew off at the speed of light.

Now, you're moving forward at the speed of light and you want to go forward faster. That's too bad; you always move at the speed of light, and you don't have anything left to borrow from your movement in time."	0

"I'll expand on the other comments. 


Yes, there are several viruses that will result in the common cold, the most common being rhinovirus. The fact that there are multiple viruses that can give you the disease is NOT the major reason that you can get the cold more than once, since you can be infected by the same virus, like rhinovirus, many times in your life. This is because the virus mutates very quickly. 


When human cells in your human body replicate, they have to create an exact copy of your DNA. Your cells do this very, very efficiently and effectively because there are *many* methods of fixing mistakes in your DNA. When viruses replicate their DNA/RNA, which is the part that they inject into you so you get sick, they (usually) *do not* have any way to fix mistakes in that DNA/RNA. 


These mistakes in DNA/RNA lead to proteins (little parts in cells that actually do work) that have slightly different shapes. After infection with rhinovirus for the first time, our immune system will be trained to recognize the very specific shapes of the proteins that come from this virus. However, since the virus can mutate so quickly, the second time that you're infected by rhinovirus, the proteins from the virus will probably be a different shape than last time so your immune system can no longer fight it off effectively. 



Edit: If anyone has specific questions, I'll literally be sitting here all day."	0

"  We critically examine a scenario for the enrichment of the interstellar
medium (ISM) in which supernova ejecta follow a long (10^8 yr) journey before
falling back onto the galactic disk in the form of metal-rich ``droplets'',
These droplets do not become fully mixed with the interstellar medium until
they become photoionized in HII regions. We investigate the hypothesis that the
photoionization of these highly metallic droplets can explain the observed
``abundance discrepancy factors'' (ADFs), which are found when comparing
abundances derived from recombination lines and from collisionally excited
lines, both in Galactic and extragalactic HII regions. We derive bounds of
10^{13}--10^{15} cm on the droplet sizes inside HII regions in order that (1)
they should not have already been detected by direct imaging of nearby nebulae,
and (2) they should not be too swiftly destroyed by diffusion in the ionized
gas. From photoionization modelling we find that, if this inhomogeneous
enrichment scenario holds, then the recombination lines strongly overestimate
the metallicities of the fully mixed HII regions. The abundances derived from
collisionally excited lines also suffer some bias, although to a much lesser
extent. In the absence of any recipe for correcting these biases, we recommend
the discarding of all objects showing large ADFs from studies of galactic
chemical evolution. These biases must also be kept in mind when comparing the
galactic abundance gradients for elements derived from recombination lines with
those derived from collisionally excited lines. Finally, we propose a set of
observations that could be undertaken to test our scenario and improve our
understanding of element mixing in the ISM.

"ResNet and other architectures that use shortcuts have shown empirical success in several domains and therefore, studying the optimization for such architectures is very valuable. This paper is an attempt to address some of the properties of networks that use shortcuts. Some of the experiments in the paper are interesting. However, there are two main issues with the current paper:

1- linear vs non-linear: I think studying linear networks is valuable but we should be careful not to extend the results to networks with non-linear activations without enough evidence. This is especially true for Hessian as the Hessian of non-linear networks have very large condition number (see the ICLR submission ""Singularity of Hessian in Deep Learning"") even in cases where the optimization is not challenging. Therefore, I don't agree with the claims in the paper on non-linear networks. Moreover, one plot on MNIST is not enough to claim that non-linear networks behave similar to linear networks.

2- Hessian at zero initial point: The explanation of why we should be interested in Hessain at zero initial point is not acceptable. The zero initial point is not interesting because it is a very particular point that cannot tell us about the Hessian during optimization. "	0
We present an analysis of satellite galaxies, fossil groups (FGs), and galaxy clusters in the Millennium Run simulation. We find that FGs are rare objects with only 0.5% of all halos being classified as such at z=0. The number density of FGs is consistent with observations for systems with Mvir>1013M⊙/h. However, we also find that there exists a population of low-mass FGs which have not been observed yet but may be detectable by future surveys. In addition to their rarity, FGs show several other interesting properties compared to normal galaxy clusters: they tend to reside in more massive dark matter haloes than normal galaxy clusters; they contain fewer bright central galaxies; and they exhibit higher velocity dispersions. These results suggest that FGs can provide important constraints on models of galaxy formation and evolution. This work was supported by NASA grant NAG5-10842.	1
We develop an agent-based model to study the evolution of social complexity in human societies, focusing on how heterogeneity among agents can lead to increasing returns that drive economic growth and technological innovation. We find that heterogeneous populations are more likely than homogeneous ones to evolve complex economies with specialized production units, markets for goods and services, and division of labor between producers. The presence of these features leads to higher levels of productivity and population density, which further increase the benefits associated with specialization and trade. Our results suggest that the emergence of such socioeconomic structures may have been one important factor driving the evolution of human society over the past few million years. In this work we present a computational model aimed at studying the evolutionary dynamics underlying the development of socio-economic systems. More specifically, our goal is to understand what factors might be responsible for the appearance of increasingly complex forms of organization observed across many different cultures throughout history. To address this question, we focus on the role played by two key ingredients commonly found in real-world systems: (i) diversity within the population; and (ii) positive feedbacks leading to increasing returns.	1
"They talk with their beaks and tongues, like humans use our mouths to speak. They also have vocal chords that vibrate when they are talking. Parrots can imitate human speech very well because of this ability. Some parrot species even learn how to speak English! The most common type is Cockatiels which will often say ""hello"" or ""goodbye"" if you train them right. There are many different types of birds who can speak but not all of them know how to speak English as fluently as cockatiels. Birds don't usually understand what we mean by speaking though so it may seem strange at first hearing your bird talk back to you in its own language. This doesn't necessarily make sense unless you're familiar with the way birds communicate. Humans can't hear the sounds made by other animals' voices using our ears (like dogs barking); instead, we listen to these noises through vibrations on our skin called soundwaves. 
 
 Sound waves travel from an object making noise into the air around us until they reach our ear drum where they cause tiny hairs inside our ear canal to move up and down rapidly. These rapid movements create electrical signals sent along nerves to our brain telling us about what's happening outside."	1
" The IV stand is the tall coat hanger-like device that you will hang the IV bag on when you are preparing and administering it. In case you can’t find an IV stand and it is an emergency, your will have to hook the bag up to a place that is above the patient’s head, so that the force of gravity helps the liquid to flow downward into the person's vein.;
, Turn the faucet on and lather your hands with soap and water. Start with your palms and work to the back of your hands. Make sure that you also clean the areas between your fingers. The next step is to focus on washing from your fingers to your wrists. Finally, rinse thoroughly and pat your hands dry.


If there is no water source, rub your hands with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer., It is always important to check the doctor’s orders again before you begin. Giving a patient the wrong IV bag could lead to a life-threatening situation, such as an allergic reaction.


You should double check that you are giving the medication to the right patient, that you are doing it at the right date and time, that you are giving the correct medication in the correct order, and that the bag is the right volume.
If you have any questions at all, it is important that you ask the doctor before continuing so that you are 100% sure you understand what you are supposed to do.

, A set is the tube and connector that regulate how much fluid the patient will get. A macroset is used when you are supposed to give the patient 20 drops per minute, or about 100 mL per hour. Adults generally receive a macroset.A microset is used when you want to give the patient 60 drops of IV fluid per minute. Infants, toddlers, and younger children generally need a microset.
The size of the tubing (and the size of needle) that you use will also depend on the purpose for the IV. If it is an emergency situation where the patient needs fluids as quickly as possible, you will more likely choose a larger needle and tube in order to deliver the fluids and/or blood products or other medications as quickly as possible.
In less urgent situations, you may choose a smaller needle and tubing.

, The trick here is that the higher the needle gauge, the smaller the size of the needle. 14 is the largest and it is usually used to correct symptoms of shock and trauma. 18-20 is the usual kind of needle used by adult patients. 22 is usually used on pediatric patients (such as infants, toddlers, and young children) or geriatric patients with ., Always wear gloves for standard protection against blood and body fluid exposure.

, When the time comes to give the patient the IV, you will want to have all of your supplies right there. This will ensure that the procedure as quick and easy as possible.

, Look at the bag and locate the port of entry (this is located at the top of the IV bottle and is similar to a bottle cap). The port of entry is also where the macroset or microset line will be inserted. Unwrap an alcohol swab to sanitize the port of entry and the surrounding area of the bag.If you ever get confused while assembling the IV bag, there should be instructions written on the bag that you can follow. However, if you have any questions, stop what you're doing and find someone who knows what to do.

, Ensure that the drip chamber is in place (this is the part of the IV line that collects the fluid going through the patient’s vein). This is also the part where medical personnel are able to regulate the IV to make sure the patient gets the right medication.


IV pumps, or infusion pumps, are often used to help deliver a precise dose for the proper amount of time.

, Make sure that the drip chamber is half filled. Once it is half filled, let the fluid in the IV flow until it reaches the end of the line (this is to remove any air bubbles are are trapped in the line). Close it when it reaches the end by clamping the tube.


This is also termed as priming the tubing. This is an essential step, as inserting an air bubble into the patient could be fatal.

, The IV is sterile (as in it does not have any bad microorganisms on it). If the line touches the floor, the fluid in the IV could be compromised (meaning bad microorganisms could get into it and infect the patient).If the IV line does touch the floor, you will have to prepare a new IV, as the contaminated IV could potentially harm your patient. Keep the IV line close so that it does not touch the floor again.

, Be courteous, introduce yourself and tell him that you will be the one administering his IV fluids. It's best to lay all of the facts out for your patient — the needle puncturing his skin will hurt. Try to describe it so that he knows what he is getting into., Wash your hands again to ensure extra cleanliness before putting on your gloves — this can also help reassure the patient that you care about her health and protecting her against unnecessary exposure to bacteria.


Lying or sitting calms the patient down and actually reduces the amount of pain she will feel. It also ensures that she is in a stable position where she won't pass out if she has a psychological fear of needles.

, The cannula is the tube-like structure that you will insert at the same time as the needle, but it will stay in place after you take the needle out. You should look for a vein on the non-dominant arm (the one the person doesn't write with). You should look for a long, dark vein that you will easily be able to see when you are inserting the needle.Start by looking for veins lower down on the arm, or even on the back of the hand. Starting lower down will give you more ""chances"" if you are not successful at inserting the IV on your first try. If you need to try a second time, you will need to move higher up the arm, so there are benefits to trying lower down first if you can find a reasonably visible vein.
You can also look for veins that are located in the crease where the forearm meets the upper arm. These are often the easiest to insert an IV into; however, if the patient bends his arm, this can block the IV.

, When you tie the tourniquet, it will cause the vein to bulge, which will make it easier to see, and easier to insert the needle into.

, Use an alcohol swab to clean the insertion site (the spot that you will be putting the needle into). Use a circular motion when you clean the spot so that you get rid of as many microorganisms as possible. Let the area dry.Do not wave your hand over the area as if to dry it, as this can causes bacteria to be waved over the ""cleaned area"". Instead, allow the alcohol to air dry.

, Position the cannula so that you are holding it at a 30–45 degree angle to the patient’s arm and vein. Hold the cannula like you would hold a syringe so that you do not accidentally pass it through the vein. When you feel a “pop” and dark blood appears inside the cannula, decrease the angle of insertion so it is parallel to the patient’s skin.If this is your first time you are attempting this procedure, make sure you are doing so under supervision.


Push the cannula forward another 2mm. Then fix the needle and push the rest of the cannula in a little bit further.Remove the needle fully. Apply pressure above insertion site while maintaining site and connect tubing, otherwise the patient may bleed.
Dispose of the needle in a designated sharps container.
Finally, untie the tourniquet and clean the insertion site where the cannula is sticking out of the skin with a hypoallergenic dressing or alcohol swab.

, You should do this by slowly feeding the tubing into the cannula until you can connect it. Make sure that it is secure once it is connected. Slowly open the line so that the IV fluid goes into the tube and into the patient. You should also put tape on the tubing so that it stays in place on the patient’s arm.


Start by administering normal saline in order to ensure the IV is open and unobstructed.If you notice swelling in the surrounding tissue, or other problems with fluid administration, stop the saline flush and immediately remove the cannula. You will need to start the process over again.
Assuming that the saline flows normally through the IV access you have set up, you can proceed to administering what the doctor has specifically ordered through the IV.

, Regulate the IV drip rate according to the physician’s order. Usually in a clinic or hospital, the physician will order a specific rate, like milliliters per hour.

In a field setting, you will need to do this manually. The IV may have roller clamps and you need to count the drops per minute. Other IV sets already have a roller knob that you can turn and set the drops per minute so that you don’t have to count.







, Check your patient’s heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure and temperature. Report any untoward signs and symptoms. These symptoms could include an elevated heart rate, respiratory rate, difficulty breathing, hives, anaphylactic shock, or an increase in temperature and high blood pressure.

"If you're reading this page because you've been wondering which version of PokÃ©mon X & Y should you buy - well... congratulations! You've made an excellent decision!
PokÃ©mon are great fun for all ages, but especially children who love collecting them.  The best thing about buying these new versions over their predecessors is that they can play together!  This means that instead of having to split up after completing the story mode once again, you'll now be able to continue playing as friends wherever you go.   You don't need to worry too much though; even without trading cards there's still plenty of ways to keep track of what everyone has caught.    There are also some differences between the games themselves, such as:  * In Omega Ruby, players start off by choosing from three starter PokÃ©mons, while in Alpha Sapphire it's only two.  * In Omega Ruby, the player's rival is Baron, whereas in Alpha Sapphire his name is Brock.  * In Omega Ruby,...

"Authors present a parameterized variant of ELU and show that the proposed function helps to deal with vanishing gradients in deep networks in a way better than existing non-linearities. They present both a theoretical analysis and practical validation for presented approach. 

Interesting observations on statistics of the PELU parameters are reported. Perhaps explanation for the observed evolution of parameters can help better understand the non-linearity. It is hard to evaluate the experimental validation presented given the difference in number of parameters compared to other approaches.

"No, not really. No one knows how or why humans developed mathematical thinking in the first place.  It may even be that other animals can think logically and solve problems like humans do but they don't use language so their thoughts are never recorded.   Humans invented writing which allowed them to record information about themselves (and others) over time.    Yes, it's arbitrary because there isn't any reason behind our numbering systems except convenience -  if you want to count apples from 1-10 instead of 0-9 then that's your choice.   We could also invent new numbers all together such as ""apple"" = 10, ""bannana""=11 etc... No, unless they're using some form of communication similar to ours where words are used along with symbols representing ideas/objects. If you're talking about communicating directly via thought alone without speaking at all,  no way!

However I have some concerns about this work that should be addressed before publication. 

1) The proposed method does not perform well on ImageNet dataset (see Figure 1 ). This may indicate overfitting or lack of generalization ability.  It would help if more experiments are conducted with other datasets such as CIFAR-10/100. 
2) In addition,  it seems like there exists no clear relationship between the performance improvement brought by using the proposed method  and the number of layers used in deep network models. (See Table 2 )

"  Using methods of effective field theory, a systematic analysis of the
fragmentation functions D_{a/H}(x,m_Q) of a hadron H containing a heavy quark Q
is performed (with a=Q,Q_bar,q,q_bar,g). By integrating out pair production of
virtual and real heavy quarks, the fragmentation functions are matched onto a
single nonperturbative function describing the fragmentation of the heavy quark
Q into the hadron H in ""partially quenched"" QCD. All calculable, short-distance
dependence on x is extracted in this step. For x->1, the remaining
fragmentation function can be matched further onto a universal function defined
in heavy-quark effective theory in order to factor off its residual dependence
on the heavy-quark mass. By solving the evolution equation in the effective
theory analytically, large logarithms of the ratio mu/m_Q are resummed to all
orders in perturbation theory. Connections with existing approaches to
heavy-quark fragmentation are discussed. In particular, it is shown that
previous attempts to extract log^n(1-x) terms from the fragmentation function
D_{Q/H}(x,m_Q) are incompatible with a proper separation of short- and
long-distance effects.

" Obviously, if you are faking sick on the weekend so you can avoid going to school on Monday, you will be busy faking sick and won't have much time to do the things you enjoy. If there's something you definitely want to do, try to squeeze it in quickly before faking your ""sickness"".;
, Either way, both are a perfect choice. If you start the sickness too early on Saturday, you will have to keep up the masquerade all weekend and Monday, and it will be very hard and your chances of succeeding in fooling your parents that you're sick will be limited and slim.

, Make sure it is something that you don't get often, because if you have faked sick before and used the same excuse too many times, don't try it again or your parents will become suspicious of whether you are really sick or not. If you choose to start the ""sickness"" faking in the night hours of Saturday, go to your parents' room at roughly 11:00pm or 1:00am, or any time between those two, maybe a bit later, and complain of whatever sickness it is you're using.

, Your parents, if they are the sort that try to convince you, ""it was just a dream, there's no monsters"", you are likely to be tucked back into your own bed, but if your parents understand how freaked out you get after nightmares, they'll probably let you stay in their room until the night is over. If they do this, say that you feel like you're going to vomit and go and get a bucket, bowl or plastic bag for you to ""vomit"" in. This way, your parents will think that you really are sick and won't suspect you of going to so much trouble simply to fake sickness.

,, or ""How will I get through P.E. feeling so sick?"" but make sure you only point out things they know you enjoy doing.

, Also, remember to delete your computer's internet history or else your parents will definitely send you to school Monday.

, Beware, though, you also must sacrifice your Monday and be ""sick"" for the whole of that day.

, Also remember to be very, very convincing that you are sick because Monday is the day most kids choose to fake sickness, because they want an extra day off and are not ready for the weekend to end.

, Stay under the covers a lot and breathe on your hands, then rub them on your face, but if a thermometer is involved, try breathing on it behind your parents' backs, but if it becomes too hot your parents will suspect you of being seriously ill and needing the hospital, or they will know you are faking sickness and had breathed on the thermometer.

, Find something like baby powder and put it all over your face, then wash all off but it will leave a slightly pale effect. If you are pale, your parents will be more likely to believe that you're sick.

, Don't eat anything that's offered to you, but if you do accept it only pick off a little bit and chew it slowly to show that you've lost your appetite and definitely are sick. If your parents are insistent on you eating something, tell them ""I'm not hungry!"" but not too rudely or loudly. They might reconsider your ""sickness"" if you have the energy to be yelling and objecting.

, Ask for covers and fake sleeping. If you tend to twitch a lot when you fake sleeping, pull the covers right over you. Your parents are likely, though, to peer into the covers and see how you're doing. Some tips to making sure you fool them into thinking you're really sleeping are:


Don't move a lot. When they're not looking, if you're uncomfortable move slightly. Only move about every 20 minutes or so. If you keep tossing and turning, they're going to know for sure that you're not actually sleeping and are faking.
Stay still. Breathe calmly and casually, like you normally would if you were really asleep or very relaxed. This way they'll think you're deeply sleeping and your body is working on getting you better from your ""sickness"".
When you wake up from your ""sleeping"", remember to make sounds like you're sick and uncomfortable. Say something like ""ow"", which will definitely spark your parents' interest and they will likely ask, ""What's wrong?"" or think to themselves that you can't go to school on Monday.

, Definitely don't do anything you enjoy doing, because not doing it will convince your parents that you're sick if you're turning down one of your favourite things/hobbies to do. Also remember to work hard and go to a lot of trouble to fake your ""sickness"". Your parents will never suspect you of faking sickness if you go to a lot of trouble to convince them you're sick.

, There are many dangers and cautions involving this. You should also remember that your parents might just have a trick up their sleeves to catch you out in the act of faking sickness. If you honestly are hungry, you should eat something when your parents aren't going to notice, but this is also a possible danger. Your parents could catch you eating when you have ""no appetite"".

, While you are busy reading this, your parents might be reading about what kids do to fake sickness.

, There are articles about doing that that could help you in achieving those things. To fake vomit, you could try chewing something, and bring it back up your throat when it's not too far down. Read the article on wikiHow about making fake diarrhea if you want to know how to do that.

, Cough and say something to yourself like, ""I wish Mum and Dad were awake to help me"", right outside your parents' bedroom door, but as soon as they wake up quickly run to the bathroom or toilet and play the ""innocence act"". Act like nothing happened and you were just talking to yourself as you walked past their bedroom and that you didn't intend to wake them up.

, Otherwise, if they notice that you are trying very hard to get the point across that you're ""sick"", they will begin to suspect that perhaps you're not sick after all. Just try hard enough for them to decide you're sick.

, This way, they will think you're sick and won't take you to the doctor because you feel ""dizzy"" whenever you try to ""get up"".

, During the night, while you know your parents are sleeping (and any other members of your family) quickly go to the bathroom tap or the kitchen tap and wet yourself. Dry yourself but make sure you remain cold enough to have goosebumps. Once you're certain you aren't wet but have goosebumps, go into your parents' room and complain that you're cold.

, Then go to your parents' room again and complain of stomach, headache, fever or something like that. This will be your last shot at faking before the morning. Remember to keep up the masquerade in the morning as well. Wake up early deliberately to make it seem like you really do need the day off because you won't be focusing to your best at school due to going to bed late and waking up early. Act like it was your sickness that woke you up so early and kept you up so late.

, Spend a fair amount of time in the toilet (with the door shut) and then flush. Make sure your parents don't see the toilet before you flush it, because they will detect no waste to be found in the toilet bowl.

" Take your small car base piece and attach a 4 x 12 long piece to the back four raised studs of your base.This will form the bed and front cabin of your truck.;
, The recessed area of your small car base is where the cabin of your vehicle will be and where you LEGO driver will sit. Put the steering wheel and the seat in the dropped-down area., Start by taking both your square windows and stacking them, one on top of the other. Then attach these in front of the steering wheel to complete your windshield.

, Connect your fenders in front of the windshield, so the half circles point downward on either sides of the front of your truck.

, Your front end piece, also called the license plate holder, should have two studs on top and a contoured front stretching four studs wide and two studs tall. On the recessed studs on the rightmost and leftmost side of your front end add your 1 x 1 clear orange pieces.

, Your clear orange pieces should have mad the contoured front of your front end even, which will allow you to put on a flat 2 x 4 piece on top of it.


Now the orange pieces should be sandwiched between the 2x 4 plate the the front end piece.

, Place the sloped sides of these pieces to face off to each side of the truck.

, You should add the flat, smooth 1 x 2 piece between the sloped clear pieces. Then, below this, put the 1 x 2 flat piece with a middle circular stud directly below.

, The front-most part of your base that you have already attached fenders to will be the landing zone for your front end. Attach your front end to the free two studs at the very front of your base.

, The hood piece should fit evenly, covering all free studs on the top of your front end. On top of the hood should be two free studs. On these, you should attach the 1 x 2 air intake piece.

, Then:


Use 1 x 8 and 1 x 4 pieces evenly to the outside of your 4 x 12 truck bed piece to make you truck bed walls.
Leave one row of studs at the very back of your 4 x 12 truck bed piece for the hitch and license plate.

, Much like you did with the front end, you will use your license plate holder piece to create the back of your truck. On the left and right recessed studs on the top four-across row of your rear end, add red sloped pieces, slopes facing outward. Between these, attach your license plate.

, This includes a flat, yellow 1 x 4 piece with black diagonal slashes on it. This will be your read bumper. Attach it so that it stretches across the bottom of your license plate holder piece.

, On the free four studs at the very back of your 4 x 12 truck bed piece, connect your rear end. Make sure the edges meet with the walls of the bed of your truck and the rear end piece is firmly fastened.

, Then, stretching across the gap made by the 2 x 8 pieces:


Attach two 2 x 4 blocks, on on top the other, so that both are flat against the back wall of your cabin.
Attach two 1 x 4 pieces behind the 2 x 4 blocks.
This should create an flat surface that is level with the roof of your cabin.

, A single row of studs should hang free the hood/window area of your truck.


Attach your sloped window atop the 4 x 8 on the front-most studs.

, The hood cover should go in the front-center of the 4 x 8 piece for the most realistic effect. Use 1 x 8 smooth pieces on the top of the walls of the bed of your truck.


Leave two free studs on the walls of the bed of your truck closest to the cabin.

, On top of this block, add a 2 x 2 flat piece, and atop that add a 2 x 2 spinning piece. This will allow the front wheels of your car can turn left and right. Now you can press your wheels onto the circular axles on the outside of the 2 x 4 axle piece.

, Then:


Attach the wheel assembly so the wheels stick out under the half circles of the fenders.

, You're going to need to fashion two 2 x 2 half axles into a single piece to give the rear wheels of your truck more width. Use a 2 x 2 piece attached to the underside of the two half axles to create one 2 x 4 axle.

, Then on the 2 x 4 block, add two 2 x 2 pieces, or a single 2 x 4 piece, so that all piece form flat sides.

, Then push your wheels onto the rear axle to finish the assembly.


Attach your wheels so the back edge of your connecting block is beneath the fourth stud from the rear of the bed of your truck.
You might also experiment with rear wheel placement to find what looks best for you.
Do not attach your wheel assembly to the very back of the underside of the bed of your truck; you will need some space to attach the hitch of your truck.

, Your hitch begins with a 2 x 6 flat piece. Take this 2 x 6 and add to the back-most two studs a 1 x 2 hitch piece. The hitch piece should have a round, upward facing part, which is the hitch.

, You should allow your hitch to stick out from the back of your truck about three studs. This will make your truck hitch look more realistic.

, The bed of your truck closest to the cabin still has a slight gap. Close this off to complete the bed of your truck. Do this by attaching two 1 x 2 pieces on top of each other. Then:


Attach your 1 x 2 pieces between the walls of the bed of your truck closest to the cabin.

, Then put a 1 x 1 piece with a circular stud on the side on the rear corner of your 2 x 4 flat where it attaches to the sloped piece.


The 1 x 1 piece with a circular side stud is where your LEGO truck can be filled up with fuel.

, The free hanging back four studs of your flat 2 x 4 piece should be pressed into the bottom of your car base beneath the driver's side door. Then, open the door and put a LEGO figurine inside. It's time to go truckin'!

" By shopping around at several mortgage lenders, you can determine which ones offer the best interest rates.Finding the lowest rate can save you significant amounts of money over the term of the mortgage.


You may be able to get a general sense of mortgage rates in your area by using online tools offered by real estate websites, banks, or other lenders.However, to get a specific quote, you will need to contact or visit lenders.;
, If interest rates change, your rate will change. A rate lock, however, is a legally binding promise (qualified by any special terms) that you will get a specified rate from a lender.

, This means that a varying number of “points” are charged depending on the conditions of the rate lock. These points translate into different fees. For instance:


In many cases, it is free to lock in a rate for up to 30 days (in some cases, up to 45 days).
Typically, rate locks are guaranteed thereafter in 30-day increments, with higher fees for longer terms. A 90-day rate lock, for example, will cost more than a 60-day rate lock; a 120-day rate lock will cost more than a 90-day one.
One point equals one percent of the loan amount., While locking in a mortgage rate can protect you against interest rate hikes, it can also prevent you from benefiting if interest rates fall.Some lenders, however, offer a mortgage rate lock float down, which allows you to make a one-time decision to exchange your locked-in rate for a lower one.Thus, it can be in your best interest to find a lender which offers this possibility.

, Some lenders require a clause in mortgage rate lock agreements that allows the quoted rate to rise by a certain limited amount if interest rates rise before you close on a house. This is known as a rate cap.Even with a rate cap, a mortgage rate lock agreement offers you some protection from rising interest rates. However, by shopping around for interest rates you will determine the best agreement terms, and find out if any lenders do not require a rate cap.

, There can be considerable pressure to do this as soon as possible. However, this isn’t always the best idea.


In some cases, mortgage rates might fall. Talk to your realtor or another knowledgeable individual about current trends and expectations for rate activity.
Some lenders charge a rate lock deposit, which you may or may not want to or be able to pay.
Some lenders will lock in your mortgage rate at a slightly higher rate than the current rate. This allows you to continue to shop for a home while avoiding a rise in interest rates. However, if it turns out you did not need to lock in your rate, you will end up being charged more than was necessary.

, If you decide that you do not want to seek a mortgage rate lock from a lender, then the rate will “float.” This means that your rate will be set at whatever the prevailing rate is shortly before your scheduled closing date., Once you have decided on the best lender and/or interest rate, request to see a blank copy of the lender’s rate lock form, if possible. This will give you an exact sense of what to expect before submitting your own application. If you have time, you can have the blank form looked at by your realtor and/or real estate lawyer for approval.,


Rate lock fees can be several hundred dollars. In many cases, a rate lock fee might be refunded, unless your mortgage application is canceled.

, Depending upon the institution, you may have several ways to make the request (phone, fax, in-person visit, etc.). However you initially contact the institution, it is important to get the request in writing.Send a document that specifies the rate you would like to lock your mortgage in at, and any applicable points or other terms. Make sure that your request is signed and dated by you and any co-borrowers.


Most lenders will connect you with a mortgage consultant or office to contact when you are ready to request your rate.
Your realtor or real estate attorney can help you in preparing this request.
When sending your request, make sure that you have completed any application and made any deposit your lender requires to get a mortgage.

, Your lender should send you a letter confirming your request for a rate lock within a specified period (usually a brief one, such as 5 days).If your request is approved, you should get a written confirmation from your lender. Make sure that the confirmation displays:The agreed-upon rate
Whether or not the rate is guaranteed
The property address
The loan amount and program (i.e., the mortgage period)
The lock in fee
The lock in date
The lock in expiration date
Any special terms or conditions
The lender’s and borrower’s signatures

, In certain situations, you can re-negotiate the rate lock terms; in others, you will either have to accept the new rate or seek a new mortgage. For example:


If rates change in between making a lock in request and its approval, the original request will be void. You will then have to re-negotiate the request, if desired.
If you change the kind of loan you are requesting, or the terms of the loan (for example, the amount of your down payment), your rate can change.
Your rates can also change if your credit score rises or falls during or after the process of making the rate lock request.
If your income cannot be verified, lenders may not be able to honor a rate guarantee.
A change in the appraised value of the home you are seeking to buy can also result in a change to your rate.

"The paper proposes to prune a neural network by removing neurons whose operation is highly correlated with other neurons. The idea is nice and somewhat novel - most pruning methods concentrate on removal of individual weights, however I haven't done a through research on this topic. However, the experimental and theoretical justification of this method need to be improved before publication:

1. Experiments. The authors do not report accuracy degradation while pruning in the tables, laconically stating that the networks did not degrade. This is not convincing. The only details are given in Figure 5, however this Figure disagrees with Table 2: in the Table, the number of parameters ranges from 40k-600k, while the Figure pictures the range 12k-24k. Unless more details are provided, simply claiming that a network can remove 50% neurons with no number on the degradation of accuracy is not convincing.

2. Theory. The proofs do not match the experimental conditions and make unreasonable assumptions. The proofs show that in the absence of biases a network with a constant output will have two correlated neurons that generate the output offset. However, this is exactly why networks have biases and doesn't explain why noise injection helps (the proof suggests that all should be fine with deterministic auxiliary neuron). My interpretation is that the noisy output injects gradient noise (see e.g. the concurrent ICLR submission "	0

"Being assertive is an important part of communicating effectively, especially at work.  Being able to express your feelings and ideas without being rude can help you get along better with colleagues.   This will also allow you to have greater control over how people treat you because they’ll know exactly where you’re coming from.   ... How do I become more assertive?   What does it mean to communicate assertively?  Why should we learn to communicate assertively?
 ・ It helps us feel less stressed by expressing our true feelings and wants instead of bottling them all inside.  ・ We may find ourselves saying yes too often just so other people won’t be upset (especially family members).  By learning to speak up for ourselves,... 
Assertive Communication Model

The following steps outline the process used during assertive communication:    1) Observe the facts surrounding any conflict or problem.  2) Express your feelings related to these facts.  3) Listen carefully to their responses.  4) Respectfully state your position again.  5) Agree upon next steps together.  6) Follow through on agreed-upon actions.  7)  Repeat Steps 3-6 until resolution has been reached.  8)..."	1
Because of language processing centers located throughout the brain, which are responsible for understanding speech sounds as well as producing them when necessary (speech production). The auditory cortex is one such center that processes sound waves into meaningful information about what has been heard.  This area also plays an important role in hearing comprehension by analyzing incoming signals from other parts of the body including ears and eyes.   Language processing centers are not limited only to the auditory cortex; they include Broca's region, Wernicke's area, and others. Because these areas work together with each other during communication, there may be some overlap between their functions depending on how much input or output needs to occur at any given time. because of language processing centers located through out the brain ,which are responsible for understanding speech sounds as well as producing them  when necessary .the auditory cortex is one s uch center tha t process sound wave into meaning ful info rmation abou t wha t ha ve bee n heard	1

The Stochastic Loewner Evolution (SLE) is an important tool in the study of random curves and fractals, especially those arising as scaling limits of discrete models such as lattice paths or self-avoiding walks.  The SLE trace can be thought of as a continuous version of Brownian motion with drift; it has been shown to have connections to many other fields including quantum gravity, string theory, statistical mechanics, probability theory, mathematical physics, number theory, and computer science.   In this article we will give a brief introduction to the basic concepts behind the SLE process, along with some examples that illustrate its use. We also provide references for further reading on the subject. For more information about the SLE process see the following articles:  http://arxiv.org/abs/math/9906028 http://arxiv.org/sabs/0909.0366 http://arxiv.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.71.026110	1
"  Observational cosmology provides us with a large number of high precision
data which are used to derive models trying to reproduce ``on the mean'' our
observable patch of the Universe. Most of these attempts are achieved in the
framework of a Friedmann-Lema\^itre cosmology where large scale homogeneity is
assumed. However, we know, from the observation of structures at increasing
scales, that these models are only approximations of a smoothed or averaged
inhomogeneous underlying patern. Anyhow, when modelling the Universe, the usual
method is to use continuous functions representing the kinematical scalars of
the velocity field, implicitly assuming that they represent volume averages of
the corresponding fine-scale inhomogeneous quantities, then put them into the
Einstein equations which are solved to give the model and its dependance upon a
number of parameters arbitrarily defined. In General Relativity, such a method
is very much involved since the equations which determine the metric tensor and
the quantities calculated from it are highly nonlinear. The question raised by
the method consisting of determining the parameters of an a priori assumed FLRW
model from observational data is the ``fitting problem'' brought to general
attention by Ellis and Stoeger in the 80's. This problem has recently
experienced a reniewed attention due to the amount of available data and the
increase of the minimum scale at which homogeneity can be assumed. We propose a
discussion of this issue in the light of the latest developments of
observational and theoretical cosmology.

"The Koch brothers-- having inherited vast wealth from their father-- engage in self interested advocacy under the rubric of ""libertarianism,"" seeking to pass the cost of their industrial businesses onto the citizens/taxpayers using numerous schemes, including regulatory capture.  

They are known for ignoring health, safety and pollution regulations in the instances they have been unable to capture a given regulatory agency, including poisoning whole communities with cancer causing benzene:

As mentioned in the Bloomberg link above, one former Koch Industries employee called the practices “The Koch Method” — with managers showing subordinates “how to steal and cheat.”

As the article provides: 

""Koch Industries units 
have also rigged prices with competitors, 
lied to regulators and repeatedly run afoul of 
environmental regulations, resulting in 
five criminal convictions since 
1999 in the U.S. and Canada.""

The issue most redditors know about is their wholesale poisoning of American politics for personal financial gain: they are creators and funders of the Tea Party, though they have tried to hide this fact.

In short, the Koch brothers are sociopaths who, having inherited vast wealth from daddy, have never had to toil in uncertainty, have never had to look in a mirror.  Their general political scheme is to turn citizens against citizens, white against blacks, Christians against non Christians, heterosexuals against gays, class against class, etc-- to control them."	0
"A Fool Who'll is the third album by Australian folk singer-songwriter Laura Jean. It was released on 29 August 2011 via Chapter Music.

Reception 

Samantha Allemann for ArtsHub Australia, rated A Fool Who'll as five-out-of-five stars and explained, ""[it] succeeds in putting together nine songs which are interestingly diverse, yet all equally strong. There's no filler, and that is something quite rare indeed. Laura Jean's gorgeous voice and strong range is well matched by her band and their new electric approach, resulting in an album that's both dynamic and sweet.""

The Sydney Morning Heralds Bernard Zuel noticed that Jean, ""does not fear intimacy"", as the album is, ""dominated by the mix of emotion that comes with falling in love."" She shows, ""The thrill of love is definitely there... but so is its travelling partner in any love affair: the fear of losing that love.""

Melbourne's radio station 3RRR's staff listed it as their Album of the Week on 29 August 2011, with the summary, ""[it] offers the understated but captivating style of previous recordings, and imbues its songs with elements of disquiet, and dissonance... [it] reflects an evolution in [her] sound and approach. Incorporating new sounds.""

"The authors of this article are trying to answer whether deep convolutional networks really need to have many layers in order for them to work well.  They do so with an experiment that shows how adding more layers does not necessarily improve performance on some datasets.
Strengths:

This is very interesting research because it sheds light into one aspect of CNNs which has been debated since their invention. 

Weaknesses: 

I think there could've been better ways to showcase these results than just showing tables.   The figures would make things easier to understand.  

Also I feel like they should've done something about overfitting as it's mentioned several times but never explained clearly enough.

"We present new abundance determinations for the light neutron-capture elements Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, La, Ce, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Dy, Yb, and Lu in eight planetary nebulae (PNe). The PNe are selected to have high signal-to-noise ratio optical spectra obtained with HST/STIS or FUSE that allow accurate measurements of their elemental abundances. We find that all but one PN show evidence for enrichment by the slow-neutron capture process (s-process) relative to solar values. In most cases we can identify specific s-process contributions from individual isotopes such as 92Zr, 138Ba, 144Sm, 146Eu, 151Gd, 157Dy, 162Yb, 174Lu, 176Hf, 182W, and 205Pb. These results provide important constraints on theoretical models of nucleosynthesis in low-mass asymptotic giant branch stars.

" You will most likely need it to disassemble and reassemble various parts. Also verify that your model is equipped with a timing chain and not a timing belt. These two parts perform the same task, but replacing them can be quite different. This procedure is only for replacing a timing chain.;
, Having your engine clean allows you to better locate any leaks or worn parts. It also makes the job less messy overall. Never clean or work on your engine while it is hot.Keep in mind that the degreaser and oils you are washing off of your engine can kill your grass and pose an environmental threat. This should be done somewhere that is properly set up to drain and filter the chemicals used., This may be stamped directly on the engine (either on the cylinder head, valve covers, or intake manifold) and sometimes listed in the owner’s manual specifications.You can also use a service manual to determine firing order.This will be necessary to know because later you will need to check your number one cylinder (the one that fires first in the firing order).

, You should not work on your engine with the battery plugged in. First remove the ground cable (negative terminal) and then remove the positive terminal.

, This will allow the coolant to be drained from the system.

, The drain cock is located near the bottom of the radiator and is a plastic screw or pull cap that you can release. Engine coolant is a mix of water and antifreeze. It is very toxic and should be stored in a plastic container with a screw-on cap. An old antifreeze bottle is ideal., Trace the radiator hoses from the radiator back to the engine. Squeeze the hose clamps with pliers and slide them back onto the hose. Wiggle the hose to break it free and move it out of the way.


There is no need to remove the radiator. The hoses need to be loosened and the coolant drained for the purpose of removing the water pump in a later step.

, This can usually be found posted underneath the hood of your car or in your service manual for serpentine belts (S-belts). If you drive a much older car, you may have a multi-belt design (V-belt). Either way, if you cannot find a routing diagram you should take a picture or draw one before removing the belt(s).

, For serpentine belts this is done by compressing the spring loaded tensioner. Some tensioners can be compressed with simple hand tools such as a wrench, and others may require a special tool. V-belts can be removed by adjusting the position of one of their pulleys to release tension.

, Once tension is released, the belt should slide off of the other pulleys easily.

, If your model has heater hoses attached to the water pump, loosen the hose clamps with a screwdriver and slide them back onto the hose.Wiggle the hose and pull it off of the water pump.

, Take out any bolts that hold the water pump to the engine. Usually there are three to five bolts to remove. Once the bolts are removed, you should be able to pull the pump off with your hands., Remove the bolt and washer in the center of the pulley. Put the bolt partially back in the bolt hole and use a harmonic balancer removal tool. The tool should not be a jaw type tool, but instead should apply all of the removal force to the center of the assembly. This protects the rubber ring in the harmonic balancer., Unbolt the timing chain cover from the engine block. Note that the bolts are different lengths so have a system in place to remember which bolt goes where when you put the cover back on. One good method is to put them back into their proper holes in the timing chain cover and set it off to the side.

, These gears are connected by the timing chain so that the position of the piston (connected to the crankshaft) correlates directly to the opening of the fuel and exhaust valves (operated by the camshaft) to keep your engine running smoothly. These gears should each be marked to help you reference their relative position.

, These links are brighter than the other links and are used to align your engine.

, To get your engine to top dead center, line the bright links on the timing chain up with the marks on your camshaft and crankshaft gears.Remember that the crankshaft can be set to top dead center both on the compression and exhaust strokes of the piston.You want top dead center for the compression stroke, so you can insert

, This can be done by loosening the tension gear with a wrench or ratchet. Next slide the chain off of the gears.

, Using a little gear oil now will help to ensure that your chain and gear perform optimally for as long as possible.

, You want the bright links on the new chain to line up exactly with the marks on the gears just like the old chain did. This will allow you to locate top dead center if you ever need to.

, Some chains are tensioned by adjusting either the crankshaft gear or the camshaft gear, while others have an automatic tensioner. This will vary by make and model of your car. The important thing is to make sure that your timing belt is as tight as it should be.

, This is the rubber seal around the crankshaft and the timing cover.

, The seal should be seated into the correct place on the timing cover. It will seal when the cover is bolted onto the engine.

, It is necessary to coat the seal with oil to ensure proper functioning when the seal is compressed., The bolts are varying lengths. Remember the system you set up to keep track of which bolts went where and be sure to use the proper bolt in the proper location.

, There is only the one bolt in the center that fastens the harmonic balancer into place. Check you owner’s manual or service guide for proper torque specifications.

, Replace the bolts that fasten the water pump to the engine block.

, If you removed heater hoses from your water pump, you will need to slide them back onto the water pump. Once the hose is on the pump you can squeeze down the hose clamp with pliers and slide it up over where the hose and pump connect. If the clamp has a tightening screw, tighten it with a screwdriver. This will secure the hose to the pump.

, If the lower radiator hose is still removed or if you removed the upper hose for any reason, put them back on the radiator now. Once the hose has been slid onto the radiator, use a pair of pliers to move the clamps up the hose to the place where the hose and the radiator meet. This will fasten the hose to the radiator.

, If your coolant looks dirty or if it has been more than a year since you last changed the coolant in your vehicle, use new coolant. Dilute the coolant as specified in your owner’s manual or service guide and fill to the mark that says “cool” or “cold” on the tank. If your coolant is clean and relatively new, you can pour the old coolant back into your radiator.

, You should use the routing diagram stamped on your hood or printed in your owner’s manual to make sure that the belt is run properly. Pulleys with grooves are intended to meet the grooved side of the belt, but some flat pulleys are meant to be driven by the flat backside of the belt., This can be done by releasing the tensioner in a serpentine design. If you are working with a V-belt design then you will need to tension the belt manually. A good rule of thumb is that the belt should have a maximum of 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) of movement in the middle of the belt's longest run.Check your vehicle manual for more information. If in doubt, consult a mechanic.

, You do not want to start your engine without all of the appropriate accessories hooked up. Take a second look over everything and make sure that all is well before moving on.

, Connect the positive cable first, and then connect the ground cable.

, Turn the key and start the engine.

, Look under your hood and under your car to make sure that no fluid is dripping or leaking. If you are leaking coolant, check to make sure all hoses are connected properly to the radiator and water pump. If you are leaking oil you might have to replace the crankshaft seal again.

, This ensures that all cylinders are firing at the correct time and that the valves are opening and closing properly in relation to the piston’s position.

, You can also choose any colors you like and make a customized butterfly design., That will be the color of your costume. Common colors include brown, tan, black and blue., If it is for Halloween, you may want to find a sweat suit in the color of the body. If it is spring, opt for a pair of tights and a ballet leotard in matching colors., Buy one and a half yards (1.4m) of felt in the background color of your costume., You need 1⁄4 yard (0.2 m) (0.2m) of the largest accent color and eight by 10 inches (20.3 to 25.4cm) of two or three other colors.,, Flip the wing in the center, like it is a mirror image. Continue tracing your outline, without tracing a line in the middle.

Repeat, tracing another symmetrical wing in the same color of felt. You will use these two pieces as the front and back of your wing.

, The foam will make the wings stiff when you wear them. Trace half of the wing, flip it over in the center and trace the other half, just as you did with the felt., Cut down the center of one piece of foam and one piece of felt. This is how you will turn the wings right side out after you are done sewing them., Trace them onto different colors of felt. Remember that you will need four sets of markings in the same colors, so that the butterfly wings look symmetrical., Pin the other set on the other piece of felt. Topstitch the markings to the felt wing with your sewing machine or a needle and thread., Pin them together at the edges., Make sure you use thread that matches your main felt color. Turn the wings inside out.

Sew the center section together by hand or with a sewing machine.

, They will fit around your armpits. Each strap should be 9 to 15 inches (23 to 38cm) long, depending upon the size of the person wearing the wings.,, Curl them by wrapping them around your finger.,"	0
"Oh man, I just read something about this not too long ago. I will see what I can recall...

Basically, Americans in 1776 did have British accents in that American accents and British accents hadn’t yet diverged. That’s not too surprising.

What’s surprising, though, is that those accents were much closer to today’s American accents than to today’s British accents. While both have changed over time, it’s actually British accents that have changed much more drastically since then. Between the American revolution and now, the lower class began modeling their speech more closely to that of the posh upper class aristocracy. The main difference being a thing called ""rhotacism"". Rhotic speakers pronounce the ""r"" in words like ""water"" and ""butter"" hard. So, ""wat-urr"", and ""but-turr"". Non-rhotic speakers would pronounce the r ""soft"", as in ""wat-ah"" and ""but-tah"". 

And as it were, non-rhotic speakers are still very common in America, especially in cities on the east coast (think of a New York or Boston accent).

TL;DR American and British accents were quite similar at one point, but the British accent has changed more over time to reflect the speech of aristocracy."	0

"The authors present an interesting approach to multi-modal learning, which is based on tensor factorization and deep neural networks.
They show that their method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in several tasks such as image classification or video captioning.  The proposed model can be trained end-to-end using stochastic gradient descent with backpropagation through time (BPTT). This makes it possible to train very large models efficiently even though they are not differentiable wrt all parameters at once. 
I think this work has great potential but I have some concerns about how well the results generalize beyond the training data set. 

In particular, there seems to be no explicit regularizer preventing overfitting of the learned representations onto specifics of the training dataset. It would also help if more details were provided regarding hyperparameters used during experiments.  

Overall, it's good research!"	1

On Monday 31st May the remaining six teams competed in three further matches at Croke Park where the finalists were decided as well as who would play in Sunday 6th June's third-place game.  The final itself was contested between Kilkenny and Tipperary on Sunday 7th June at Croke Park."	1

Hold the thick end of the cue in your dominant hand with your palm facing upward. Find the spot on the wrap where the cue evenly balances. Grip your cue about 1"" behind that spot.
Make a circle with the thumb and index finger of your non-dominant hand. Put the cue through the circle and rest it on the top of your middle finger, behind the knuckle. Spread out your ""pinky"", ring and middle finger tips to create a tripod-like support.
Place the ridge of your hand should on the table. Lift the other side of your hand a bit higher.;
,









Place the foot that is on the same side as your non-dominant hand in front.
Position your other foot about 2 feet (60 cm) behind the front foot.
Turn your body slightly away from the table so that it doesn't interfere with the shot.
Position yourself close to the table but not too close to the table. You want to lean into the shots a bit for more control.
Proper form requires the cue stick to be directly below your chin during a stroke. If you compare the form of a professional pool player with that of a novice pool player, the professional player will always keep their head down also known as ""being down on the ball"" with the cue directly below his or her chin during the stroke.

, Avoid twisting the chalk on top of the cue.








,, Imagine that you are moving your arm through the water in a swimming pool instead of hitting the ball with a quick strike. A longer stroke imparts more momentum to the ball.








, The cue should continue on its course and almost hit the table ahead of the ball's starting position. Your cue shouldn't slow down until the tip has actually hit the ball.








, This position allows you to analyze the angle of the ball and the direction of every other ball that it strikes. It also ensures that you don't cause the shot to deviate by accidentally introducing a jumpy motion.








,,, Angle the cue so that it creates a parallel line from right above the cue ball to the target.








, Maintain the angle that you just made when you lined up the ball and the pocket.








, Pull the rest of the cue around to the right or left until the cue is positioned over the white ball. You now have the angle at which you need to hit the white ball to sink the other ball.








, Strike the center of the white ball so that it makes contact with the other ball.








, It will make you less likely to win the current game but more likely to win future games. Sometimes in pool, you get a shot that would be an awkward angle with your dominant hand, but your non-dominant hand will gain skill faster for those awkward shots if you play with your non-dominant hand all the time than if you just do it for those shots. In fact, skill transfers somewhat from one task to another task to your non-dominant hand will gain skill for pool faster if you you do everything with your non-dominant hand than if you just play pool with your non-dominant hand like in other activities.








,









Choose a larger wrap if you have large hands and a smaller wrap if you have small hands. The most important point is to find a wrap that feels good in your hands.
If your hands sweat, choose a cue wrapped in Irish linen for absorption. Otherwise, choose a leather wrap or a cue with no wrap.

, Most shafts have a diameter of 12mm to 13mm. While 13mm is the most commonly selected size, a smaller shaft can make the bridge position more comfortable for people with smaller hands.








, The shaft maintains its diameter for 10"" to 15"" before it starts to taper toward the cue. A shorter taper gives you a firmer hit.








, Most players choose a weight between 19 and 20 ounces.








, Most cues are 57"" or 58"" long, but you can special order different lengths.








, Cue tips are made of leather and generally rated medium to hard. A tip that will wear well gives you better control of the ball.








, Any loose parts will absorb the energy from your shots and will hamper your ability to strike the ball well.

" Contract the corners of your mouth to form a round shape with your mouth before phrases like “Oh dear” or “Minnes-ohhh-ta” and extend the emphasis on this vowel.


This is a similarity to Canadian accents in some areas.
Practice by saying the word “Sound”. While it only has one syllable and can be said quickly, a Minnesotan might say “S-ownd” or “S-ow-und” as a part of regular speech.;
, The “I” should be drawn out and spoken with the mouth open and the tongue behind the bottom front teeth. This is also true when using names and words with the letter “y”.


Practice by saying the word “Why” and drawing out the vowel.

, For example, the words “are,” “work” and “mother” rely more heavily on the letter “R” in the Minnesota dialect. Stress the “err” sound.


Try saying the phrase “Oh, dear” to practice the “O” and the “R” together. It can sound like “Oo-ha, De-arr”.

, This is often called “Minnesota nice” because they use an inquisitive tone when speaking with other people. There are several changes in tone throughout a sentence.


Use the phrase “Oh, that’s interesting”. Although it is a statement and shouldn’t end with an inflection, the Midwestern accent would include an upward inflection with the word “interesting”. it is basically being passive in an aggressive way.

, Thanks to a large influx of Swedish and Norwegian immigrants in the 19th and 20th centuries, the Minnesota accent has a sing-song quality, employing inflections and words like “Yah” for “Yes”.Try the comic phrase “Ya sure, you betcha” to practice your use of the regional pronunciation.

, For example, “Have to” is often “hafta”, while “I’m going to” is “eye-mina” and “what are you” is “what-cha”.

, It is a generic, but common reply to questions like “You doing alright?” or “Are you full?”

, Almost all of Minnesota and most of the Midwest call Coke, Pepsi and other sodas “pop”.

, For example, “I didn’t buy that dress because it was too spendy”.

, Other like “can” are pronounced with a similar soft “eh” sound.

, This phrase and “Nice to meet you” are used to indicate you’d like to depart. You also might want to draw out your goodbye like a true Minnesotan and talk about the weather, sports, and politics. This is known as the ""Minnesotan goodbye"".

, For example, “cash” is sometimes pronounced “caish”. The word “different” is often pronounced with two syllables as “diff-rent”.,, This is the act of being outwardly nice, without conveying your real opinions or emotions. It is often referred to as “passive aggressive” or “enthusiastic neutral” tone because of the friendly inflections while saying something negative.

, This form of non-verbal communication is used when driving and greeting oncoming cars or pedestrians. You lift your index finger off the steering wheel for a second and set it back down.

, If someone asks your opinion and you want to show a little opinion, “that’s different” will show that you don’t like it, without having to go into detail., Minnesotans may talk while at a 45-degree angle or while looking out at something else. This is a way of remaining nice, non-confrontational, but not too personal.

, It’s better to say “Not bad” than “Not good”.


Pronounce “Not Bad” as “Naaht Bah-d”.

"  We demonstrate an efficient scheme for continuous trap loading based upon
spatially selective optical pumping. We discuss the case of $^{1}$S$_{0}$
calcium atoms in an optical dipole trap (ODT), however, similar strategies
should be applicable to a wide range of atomic species. Our starting point is a
reservoir of moderately cold ($\approx 300 \mu$K) metastable
$^{3}$P$_{2}$-atoms prepared by means of a magneto-optic trap (triplet-MOT). A
focused 532 nm laser beam produces a strongly elongated optical potential for
$^{1}$S$_{0}$-atoms with up to 350 $\mu$K well depth. A weak focused laser beam
at 430 nm, carefully superimposed upon the ODT beam, selectively pumps the
$^{3}$P$_{2}$-atoms inside the capture volume to the singlet state, where they
are confined by the ODT. The triplet-MOT perpetually refills the capture volume
with $^{3}$P$_{2}$-atoms thus providing a continuous stream of cold atoms into
the ODT at a rate of $10^7 $s$^{-1}$. Limited by evaporation loss, in 200 ms we
typically load $5 \times 10^5$ atoms with an initial radial temperature of 85
$\mu$K. After terminating the loading we observe evaporation during 50 ms
leaving us with $10^5$ atoms at radial temperatures close to 40 $\mu$K and a
peak phase space density of $6.8 \times 10^{-5}$. We point out that a
comparable scheme could be employed to load a dipole trap with
$^{3}$P$_{0}$-atoms.

"  We present the discovery of a 40 kpc H-alpha tail and at least 29
emission-line objects downstream of a star-forming galaxy ESO 137-001 in the
rich, nearby cluster A3627. The galaxy is known to possess a dramatic 70 kpc
X-ray tail. The detected H-alpha tail coincides positionally with the X-ray
tail. The H-alpha emission in the galaxy is sharply truncated on the front and
the sides near the nucleus, indicating significant ram pressure stripping. ESO
137-001 is thus the first cluster late-type galaxy known unambiguously with
both an X-ray tail and an H-alpha tail. The emission-line objects are all
distributed downstream of the galaxy, with projected distance up to 39 kpc from
the galaxy. From the analysis on the H-alpha_{off} frame and the estimate of
the background emission-line objects, we conclude that it is very likely all 29
emission-line objects are HII regions in A3627. The high surface number density
and luminosities of these HII regions (up to 10^40 ergs/s) dwarf the previously
known examples of isolated HII regions in clusters. We suggest that star
formation may proceed in the stripped ISM, in both the galactic halo and
intracluster space. The total mass of formed stars in the stripped ISM of ESO
137-001 may approach several times 10^7 solar masses. Therefore, stripping of
the ISM not only contributes to the ICM, but also adds to the intracluster
stellar light through subsequent star formation. The data also imply that ESO
137-001 is in an active stage of transformation, accompanied by the build-up of
a central bulge and depletion of the ISM.

"Dear all,

many thanks for sharing the paper, which I did find hugely interesting - while the GRiD corpus is small, I do agree that it is currently a good task for taking first steps towards video-based and audio-visual speech recognition, and I believe the work you did here will ultimately be very useful for lipreading (and for lipreading-based speech enhancement) in more general scenarios.

I do have one comment regarding the prior-state-of-the-art system that you cite: As far as I know, our group's Interspeech 2016 holds the record for best lipreading performance on the GRiD corpus, with 86.4% word accuracy (this does include a grammar, but it might still be interesting).
Please cite: S. Gergen, S. Zeiler, A. Hussen Abdelaziz, R. Nickel and D. Kolossa: "" Dynamic Stream Weighting for Turbo-Decoding-Based Audiovisual ASR,"" in Proc. Interspeech 2016, San Francisco, Sept. 2016.

"We report on two new brown dwarf candidates discovered by direct imaging with NACO/VLT at distances of ~100 AU to their host star, which are members of open clusters NGC 2423 (M67) and NGC 4349. The first object is located close to the cluster center and has an estimated mass between 0.03-0.07 M . It was found as part of our survey for low-mass companions to nearby young solar-type stars. We also present follow-up observations of this candidate using adaptive optics techniques that confirm its substellar nature. 
 
 The second object lies outside the core radius of the cluster and has an estimated mass below 0.01 M . This companion may be either a planetary or very-low-mass stellar companion depending on whether it formed through gravitational instability or fragmentation during cloud collapse. Both objects have masses well above those predicted by current models of planet formation via disk accretion."	1
" Set the parking gear and the brake. Block the wheels. Raise the front of the LHS with a jack(s) and support the car with jack stands. Remove the splash guards under each fender to reveal access to the mounts.
, Raise the jack only until it just begins raising the engine a very little, to mainly support the engine, but not to raise the vehicle at all., (If your mounts have a heat shield between the mount and engine, remove the nut or bolt from the bracket holding the heatshield, using your ratchet and socket. Remove the heatshield.) Keeping the nuts loosely screwed on to just a few bolt threads, on the bolts, keeps the mounts aligned until both are loosened -- retained to this same degree, held on loosely, on each side of the engine.,,,,,,

Install the heat shield and its retaining bolts, if your vehicle is so equipped (on the 3.5-liter engine, for example).

,, Snug the nuts and bolts on all both mounts, at first only ""finger tight"". Then snug them all a little., The large nuts and bolts might be torqued to about 45 to 50 foot (13.7 to 15.2 m) pounds. The smaller bolts on the transmission mount are torqued less, perhaps to about 20 to 30 foot (6.1 to 9.1 m) pounds., Raise the front of the vehicle enough to remove your jack stands or blocks and such, and lower your LHS to the ground."	0
" Some symptoms of a concussion can occur immediately after your injury, such as losing consciousness (“blacking out”), nausea, headache or a feeling of pressure in the head, dizziness, confusion, and ringing in the ears.However, sometimes you feel fine immediately after an injury, and symptoms do not begin until hours or even days later. If you hit your head, fall, or jar your head or neck like with whiplash, immediately stop what you’re doing and do not return to activity that day.


Do not try to walk or stand immediately after your injury, unless you are in immediate physical danger. Rest seated or lying down until you know you can move without feeling ill.
Athletes, usually hockey and football players, must be medically evaluated before returning to play.;
, If you feel weak on one side of your body, are vomiting continuously, are confused or anxious, have neck pain, or are very drowsy, call for immediate medical care. Severe symptoms like these may indicate a more severe brain injury.


Someone may have to call for help for you if you are unable.
If you have neck or head pain, do NOT move until help arrives. Injuries that cause concussions can also result in spinal injuries, which can cause permanent damage.

, Even if you had minimal discomfort immediately after your injury, you should get medical help right away if your symptoms worsen in the next few hours or days. You may have a headache that gets worse and worse, begin to feel clumsy or start to stumble, get progressively dizzier, or feel confused or have problems with speech., Unless you had epilepsy before your injury and have frequent seizures, having a seizure after getting a concussion may indicate a serious problem. Don’t wait to get medical attention.Post-traumatic seizures are those that occur one week after the brain injury. Post-traumatic seizures are common in those who suffer from a severe traumatic brain injury, especially those that have an intracranial hemorrhage.

, In general, your pupils (the black centers of your eyes) should be the same size. If one pupil becomes larger than the other, it may indicate a neurological condition. Go to your doctor right away., Even if you did not lose consciousness or experience immediate symptoms, see your doctor after any head injury. They will be able to evaluate you for other injuries that may have occurred, assess the severity of your symptoms, and give you further treatment advice. They may refer you for a CT scan or an MRI so they can rule out other brain injuries.Bring a friend or loved one with you to the appointment to take notes and help you later. You might have trouble concentrating and need reminders.Sometimes your doctor may refer you to other specialists, like a neurologist if you’re having severe symptoms or problems with your nerves, or a chiropractor or physical therapist to help with pain from your car accident, for instance.

, Young children can get concussions, too, but are often unable to tell you how they feel. If a child receives any injury that could cause damage to their head, watch for behavior changes and problems with balance and coordination. Children with a concussion may:Seem dazed, overly tired, or listless.
Be irritable, cranky, or very tearful.
Lose interest in toys and normal activities.
Appear off-balance or unsteady when walking or standing.
Experience changes in sleep and eating habits.

, Before returning to play, recovered child athletes should complete a full-course of non-contact exercise, this should include challenges of gradually increasing intensity., For the first 24 hours after your injury it’s important to have someone stay with you to make sure your symptoms are not getting worse.Your caregiver should be someone who knew you before the injury so that they are familiar with your baseline personality and thinking patterns. If your symptoms worsen at all, your caregiver should take you to the hospital or call for emergency medical assistance.


While you sleep during those first 24 hours, your caregiver should wake you up every 1-2 hours to check on your symptoms. You should be able to wake up normally. They can ask you what your name is, what state you live in, or what day of the week it is to ensure you aren’t getting confused. Neurological checks every 2 hours is important in the course of treatment and care.

, Despite popular belief, it’s okay to sleep when you have a concussion. You will likely require more sleep than usual as your brain recovers. Sleep is a great way to rest your brain right after your injury as well as throughout the next several weeks, so continue to nap throughout the day if you need to., If possible, take time off of work or school or find childcare so that you can rest for up to two weeks. Rest truly is the only medicine for a concussion, and the more you can rest after your injury the more quickly you will recover. Enlist family, friends or hired help to ease your burden for several weeks.

, You may be very sensitive to sounds and light after a concussion, and will likely be more comfortable keeping still than moving around. Your brain needs rest in order to heal, and this includes rest from stimulus. Lie in a quiet room with closed blinds or a towel over your eyes as much as you can.


Do not try to read, text, or watch TV to pass the time. This stimulates your brain. True brain rest requires calm, quiet, stillness, and minimal brain activation.
Avoid activities that raise your heart rate, like fast walking or lifting weights., No matter what you do, you may have post-concussion symptoms beginning a few days after your injury and lasting up to 2-3 weeks. Some people experience post-concussion symptoms for months. Symptoms may include dizziness, headaches, and difficulty concentrating.Some people also develop emotional symptoms like depression, which can last for several weeks to months.


Once a concussion has been sustained, you cannot prevent further symptoms. Rest as much as you can. Be patient and know that this is a normal part of the process.
Headaches may not develop until weeks or months after a head injury.

, This can be an uncomfortable and challenging time. In order to focus on your recovery, try to keep your stress to a minimum. Meditate daily and try mindfulness exercises. Do deep breathing techniques. Give yourself a hand massage. Do whatever calming, non-strenuous activities you enjoy.

, If you have a headache, it’s okay to take products like Tylenol that use the ingredient acetaminophen. This may alleviate some discomfort. However, do not take Advil, Motrin, or anything containing ibuprofen or aspirin – this could increase the risk of bleeding in your brain., If you have any remaining symptoms of concussion whatsoever, do not do anything that may cause further brain injury. Avoid riding a bike, playing sports, going on roller coasters – anything that may injure or jostle your brain. Second impact syndrome is caused when you get another concussion before the first heals, and it can cause fast and potentially fatal swelling of your brain.The term” second impact syndrome” is used when there is diffuse brain swelling after a second impact to the head.

, Your response time and ability to focus may be impaired after a concussion, which can make driving dangerous.Avoid driving until your symptoms improve. Speak with your doctor about your symptoms and whether it’s safe for you to drive, ride a bike, or use heavy equipment.

, After your initial time of complete rest, return to work, school, and other mental activities slowly. Start with half days, and speak with employers or teachers about having a lighter workload for several weeks as you ease back in to mental work.


Your doctor will likely be willing to write a note for you requesting this if they think you need it.

, Do not restart any physical activities or even anything that raises your heart rate until you are free of concussion symptoms and have been checked by your doctor. Then return to playing your sport, riding your bike, or exercising slowly and gradually.It is not uncommon to feel symptoms return when you start to be physical. Let your body be your guide as you increase your activity level. If you start to feel sick, stop your activity for the day and rest. You will gradually build your stamina back up.
Many sports teams have a post-concussion return-to-play protocol to ease you back in to your sport safely. If not, do not let anyone convince you to play before you’re well. Ask your doctor or a sports therapist for guidelines, and take responsibility for your health.
According to the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine and the American Academy of Neurology, the concern for recurrent concussions has lead to serious consequences such as second impact syndrome and dementia, which has lead to the development of a series of guidelines that address concussion severity and return to play for athletes., It can be frustrating trying to return to your daily life while you are having difficulty concentrating, remembering and thinking. These problems will improve, but in the mean time help yourself by making lists of things you have to remember or writing notes as ideas occur to you. Focus on one task at a time.Consult with loved ones you trust before making any important decisions while your brain is recovering.

, Drinking alcohol or using any drugs that aren’t prescribed to you can delay your recovery. Do not drink alcohol until your doctor tells you that it is safe to do so., Having had a previous concussion is a risk-factor for getting another concussion, and unfortunately the effects of concussions are cumulative over your lifetime. This means that each subsequent concussion is easier to get, and has more severe symptoms than the last. Suffering from multiple concussions can even cause permanent problems after many years. If you’ve had a concussion, consider what activities are safe for you to do.You may need to refrain from contact sports like football, rugby, hockey, and roller derby, in which concussions are common.
Some people find they can no longer go on roller coasters or handle the loud noise of concerts without feeling unwell.

, Always wear a helmet and protective gear when playing sports or riding a bicycle or motorcycle. Fasten your seatbelt any time you are in a vehicle. Check your home to ensure there is nothing you may trip over, like a loose rug., Some people experience symptoms of a concussion for much longer than others, even months or years. If you have to give up activities that you love, refrain from exercising like you once did, or struggle to be as mentally active as before your injury, you may feel discouraged, isolated or depressed. Find a local support group or join an online community to build solidarity with others who are experiencing similar struggles.


If you feel deeply depressed, anxious, or have thoughts of self-harm, seek professional care.

"David James Hess (born July 10, 1993) is an American professional baseball pitcher in the Tampa Bay Rays organization. He has previously played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Baltimore Orioles and Miami Marlins.

Amateur career
Hess played baseball at Tullahoma High School in Tullahoma, Tennessee. As a senior, he had a 8-1 win-loss record with a 1.91 earned run average (ERA) along with batting .393 with eight home runs. After high school, he enrolled at Tennessee Technological University and played college baseball for the Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles. In 2014, his junior year, he pitched to a 9-3 record with a 3.24 ERA in 16 starts.

Professional career

Baltimore Orioles
After the season, Hess was drafted by the Baltimore Orioles in the fifth round of the 2014 Major League Baseball draft. He made his professional debut with the Aberdeen IronBirds and also spent time with the Delmarva Shorebirds; in ten total games between the two teams, he  pitched to a 2–1 record and 3.24 ERA. He started 2015 with the Frederick Keys and was promoted to Bowie Baysox during the season. In 28 games (27 starts) between both clubs, he posted a 10–5 record and a 3.64 ERA. He returned to Bowie in 2016, going 5–13 with a 5.37 ERA in 25 games (24 starts). In 2017, he once again returned to Bowie, pitching to an 11–9 record with a 3.85 ERA with 123 strikeouts in a career high 154.1 innings pitched. The Orioles added Hess to their 40-man roster after the 2017 season.

Hess made his major league debut on May 12, 2018 against the Tampa Bay Rays at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. He pitched six innings, giving up three earned runs on six hits, three strikeouts, and zero walks. He remained in the Orioles rotation, totaling 21 appearances, 19 of them starts. He went 3-10 in  innings.

In his first start of the 2019 season in a 6–5 win over the Toronto Blue Jays at Rogers Centre on April 1, Hess had a no-hit bid through 6 1/3 innings before being removed by manager Brandon Hyde in favor of Pedro Araújo. With his record at 1–10 by the end of the campaign, he and Gabriel Ynoa became the first pair of teammates with double-digit losses and no more than one win since Jack Nabors and Tom Sheehan of the 1916 Philadelphia Athletics.

Hess only appeared in 3 games for the Orioles in 2020, and gave up 5 runs over 7 innings pitched. On October 29, 2020, Hess was outrighted off of the 40-man roster and became a free agent.

Tampa Bay Rays
On December 3, 2020, Hess signed a minor league contract with the Tampa Bay Rays organization. Hess posted a 2.81 ERA through 13 appearances with the Triple-A Durham Bulls.

Miami Marlins
On July 3, 2021, the Rays traded Hess to the Miami Marlins in exchange for Justin Sterner and cash considerations. The Marlins selected Hess' contract to the active roster following his acquisition. On August 14, 2021, Hess was designated for assignment by the Marlins. On August 18, Hess rejected his outright assignment and elected free agency.

Tampa Bay Rays (second stint)
On August 19, Hess signed a minor league deal to return to the Tampa Bay Rays and was assigned to Triple-A Durham. On August 21, the Rays selected Hess' contract. The following day, Hess was designated for assignment without appearing in a game. On August 24, Hess cleared waivers and was assigned outright back to Triple-A Durham. Hess's contract was selected on September 6. Hess made 1 appearance for the Rays, recording a 27.00 ERA with 2 strikeouts before he was designated for assignment on September 8. On October 14, Hess elected free agency, before re-signing with the Rays on a minor league deal on November 11.

Personal life
Hess and his wife, Devin, married in 2016. On October 13, 2021, Hess announced via Twitter that he will undergo chemotherapy after doctors discovered a cancerous germ cell tumor in his chest.

"The royal family plays a largely symbolic role and most of their duties involve putting on social functions and entertaining esteemed guests. Technically they do hold some political power though. For instance, the Queen must give royal assent to a bill before it passes and becomes law. In that sense, the monarch has the power to veto proposed legislation similar to the president of the United States. Britain has its own Prime Minister, however, who holds a position that much more closely approximates the role the US President (as compared to the Queen). 

It's also worth noting that other countries like Canada also require royal assent for new legislation and this is provided by the Governor General who is appointed to represent the British monarchy and to act on the Queen's best interests (side note: the Queen is referred to as the 'Queen of Canada' when she visits Canada). This relationship is largely a symbolic gesture however, the Queen (or rather her Governor General representative) would be very unlikely to veto any Canadian bills and Canada would probably just declare full independence from Britain if the Queen ever tried to over-step her boundaries and actually exercise any political control over the country."	0
"The authors present an interesting approach to training recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with sparseness constraints on their hidden units, and show that this can lead to improved performance over standard RNN models.
However I have some concerns about how they evaluate these results.  They use two different datasets - one is a synthetic dataset generated by a simple autoregressive model of order 1 which has no real-world meaning;  while another is a small subset from the Penn Treebank corpus.   The latter seems like it would be more useful as it's closer to what we might expect when using such techniques in practice.    However both are relatively small compared to many other papers I've seen recently where much larger data sets were used... 
I think there should also be discussion around whether or not the improvements reported here justify the additional complexity introduced into the network architecture.  

Overall though I'm interested enough in the topic to read further if possible"	1
"A lot of them are standard things used in farming -- pesticides, preservatives, etc. Others are intended to make the cigarette ""safer,"" by attempting to extinguish it if it's left unattended. Others are to make it burn at a certain rate, or to change the flavor profile. 

Quick point of contrast -- American Spirit cigarettes, which are promoted as Additive Free take 2X-3X longer to smoke than a regular commercial cigarette. 

Bonus fact: I'm 240 days tobacco-free today!  

EDIT: To answer OP's follow-up question -- This issue has been brought to the fore by electronic cigarettes, which use naturally extracted nicotine in a less harmful base. This is because the ""tar"" that accumulates in the smoker's lungs is naturally occurring in tobacco, and harmful despite being perfectly natural. Your assumption is correct though -- on its own, nicotine is about as harmful as caffeine. 

**Edit 2** A bunch of people asked for my How to Get Started with E-Cigs email, so [here's a link to the GoogleDoc](_URL_0_). 

Also, I just want to say that I *loved* my cigarettes, and quitting tobacco this way has turned out to be much more enjoyable, less expensive, and all around cooler. You can *totally* do it. That said, if vaping turns out to give you some other kind of cancer, well, then I'm really very sorry about all that."	0
"Imagine you had a phone booth full of water somehow sitting on the surface of a calm lake, and suddenly its walls disappeared. The water would rush out of it and create a wave that shot out in all directions until the lake evened itself out again. This is similar to how all of the air squeezed up inside a balloon pushes out and creates a pressure wave that you can hear when it bursts and equalizes with the air around it.

People are pointing out that the balloon pop itself isn't really all that loud, it's mostly the acoustics of the room around it. To understand this, imagine you have the same phone booth sitting at the middle of a circular swimming pool. When the water rushes out, the resulting wave will bounce off of the outer edge of the pool and rush back inwards. It can then combine with itself and cause even bigger waves! Where the water in the lake will soon just have a small wave spread over a large area, the pool water will still have really big waves for a while after as they bounce around and interact with each other. If you pop a balloon in an 'anechoic chamber' (basically like a pool whose walls absorb waves completely and don't let them bounce back) then you'll only hear that first smallish wave of pressure."	0
"Separation of church and state is much-misunderstood concept.

The principle is designed purely to protect an individual's religious liberty. It prevents the government controlling religion - so the government can't tell the church what to teach or what to believe. It also prevents the government imposing a state religion. So it prevents the state forcing everyone to become Muslim or everyone to become Christian etc. So the state can't impose a religion on anyone, nor can it tell a religion how to operate.

Obviously, this doesn't mean that there aren't laws that apply to religious organisations - tax regulations, for example. It also doesn't mean that religious practices are freely permitted if they violate other laws (such as murder). Conversely, it doesn't mean that religious convictions can't be applied when voting or making the law (if that reflects the will of the people). For example, a senator can vote against abortion because that is the belief of his Christian-majority state, but couldn't vote for a law that requires everyone in America to be a Christian.

Swearing on the Bible is a symbolic gesture, reflecting the large numbers of people who identify themselves as Christian in the US. It is a symbol of the commitment to tell the truth in the knowledge that God sees the truth and will know if you lie. Arguably, for an atheist, it is a powerless gesture. However, it is not a violation of church and state, because that's not something the principle was intended to cover - it is not establishing a state religion, but merely reflecting the beliefs of much of the country.

Tl;dr summary: if a law doesn't force you to practice a religion you don't believe in, or prevent you exercising your religious beliefs, it doesn't violate the separation of church and state. There are, of course, debates about what is covered - such as freedom of religious conscience vs equality legislation.

EDIT: Thanks to a number of people who have pointed out that you are not required to swear on a Bible, and can substitute for something of equivalent personal significance. This is significant as it means that no one is forced to ascribe significance to a deity they don't believe in. If it seems like everyone does it, I think that's just because in a largely Christian country, that's what a lot of people choose to do because it's significant for them personally.

PS: Thanks for all the upvotes!"	0
"We study the possibility that electroweak symmetry breaking is triggered by strong dynamics at an ultraviolet (UV) fixed point, as suggested by gauge-Higgs unification models with warped extra dimensions. We show how this scenario can be realized within the framework of composite Higgs models based on strongly-coupled gauge theories. In particular we consider two different realizations of such scenarios: one where the Higgs arises as a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson associated to spontaneous breaking of approximate global symmetries; another where it emerges as a bound state of new fermions charged under the Standard Model gauge group. The latter case leads to novel signatures for Higgs production through gluon fusion which are potentially observable at future colliders. Finally, we discuss possible implications of these results for cosmology. Gauge-Higgs unification provides a compelling explanation for why the weak scale is so much smaller than any other mass scale in nature [1] . It also offers a natural solution to the hierarchy problem between the Planck and TeV scales [2] , since quantum corrections to the Higgs potential are cut off at the UV scale [3] .
In order to realize this idea in practice, however, several challenges must be overcome [4] : i) the Higgs should arise naturally out of some strongly coupled sector; ii) the Higgs couplings to SM particles should agree with experiment; iii) there should exist a mechanism to generate masses for all SM fields without introducing large hierarchies among them. These issues have been addressed recently using the Randall-Sundrum model [5] , where the Higgs field lives on the IR brane while gravity propagates into the bulk [6] - [8] . This setup allows for a calculable description of the Higgs physics [9] , but introduces additional complications due to the presence of Kaluza-Klein gravitons [10] ."	1
"This list of people executed in New York gives the names of some of the people executed in New York, both before and after statehood in the United States (including as New Amsterdam), as well as the person's date of execution, method of execution, and the name of the Governor of New York at the date of execution.  1963 marked the last execution in New York State. Some executions recorded during the 17th and 18th centuries do not indicate the name(s) of the executed and therefore are not included.

Regarding electrocutions, which comprise a large percentage of the executions: 
 55 people (54 men and 1 woman) were electrocuted at Auburn Correctional Facility

My overall conclusion is that the paper needs more work to be sufficiently convincing. I think the reviews are sufficiently careful. My recommendation is based on the fact that none of the reviewers supports acceptance.	0
By smell or scent tracking (scenting) of their targets' body odor on clothing worn by those being pursued.  This is done with great accuracy but can be fooled if the person wearing that particular piece of clothing has been in contact with another individual who also wore it recently.   The dog's nose will pick up traces from both individuals which may cause confusion to its handler.    Dog handlers are trained to recognize these situations so they know when not to shoot at an animal or human target because there might have been some mistake made due to cross-contamination of odors. Cross contamination happens frequently enough where police/military trainers teach their animals to ignore certain types of smells once they've learned what they're looking for. Scent tracking goes wrong very rarely. Very rarely. It usually works well though. Usually works well. Police dogs use scent tracking to find criminals. They follow the criminal until he gets away then track him down again later.	1
"This paper presents a meta-learning algorithm which learns to learn generative models from a small set of examples. It’s similar in structure to the matching networks of Vinyals et al. (2016), and is trained in a meta-learning framework where the inputs correspond to datasets. Results are shown on Omniglot in terms of log-likelihoods and in terms of generated samples. 

The proposed idea seems reasonable, but I’m struggling to understand various aspects of the paper. The exposition is hard to follow, partly because existing methods are described using terminology fairly different from that of the original authors. Most importantly, I can’t tell which aspects are meant to be novel, since there are only a few sentences devoted to matching networks, even though this work builds closely upon them. (I brought this up in my Reviewer Question, and the paper has not been revised to make this clearer.)

I’m also confused about the meta-learning setup. One natural formulation for meta-learning of generative models would be that the inputs consist of small datasets X, and the task is to predict the distribution from which X was sampled. But this would imply a uniform weighting of data points, which is different from the proposed method. Based on 3.1, it seems like one additionally has some sort of query q, but it’s not clear what this represents. 

In terms of experimental validation, there aren’t any comparisons against prior work. This seems necessary, since several other methods have already been proposed which are similar in spirit.

"This paper proposes an extension of neural network language (NLM) models to better handle large vocabularies. The main idea is to obtain word embeddings by combining character-level embeddings with a convolutional network.

The authors compare word embeddings (WE),character embeddings (CE) as well a combined character and word embeddings (CWE). It's quite obvious how CE or CWE embeddings can be used at the input of an NLM, but this is more tricky at the output layer. The authors propose to use NCE to handle this problem.  NCE allows to speed-up training, but has no impact on inference during testing: the full softmax output layer must be calculated and normalized (which can be very costly).

It was not clear to me how the network is used during TESTING with an open-vocabulary. Since the NLM is only used during reranking, the unnormalized probability of the requested word could be obtained at the output. However, when reranking n-best lists with the NLM feature, different sentences are compared and I wonder whether this does work well without proper normalization.

In addition, the authors provide perplexities in Table 2 and Figures 2 and 3.  This needs normalization, but it is not clear to me how this was performed.  The authors mention a 250k output vocabulary. I doubt that the softmax was calculated over 250k values. Please explain.

The model is evaluated by reranking n-best lists of an SMT systems for the IWSLT 2016 EN/CZ task.  In the abstract, the authors mention a gain of 0.7 BLEU. I do not agree with this claim. A vanilla word-based NLM, i.e. a well-known model, achieves already a gain of 0.6 BLEU. Therefore, the new model proposed in this paper brings only an additional improvement of 0.1 BLEU. This is not statistically significant. I conjecture that a similar variation could be obtained by just training several models with different initializations, etc.

Unfortunately, the NLM models which use a character representation at the output do not work well. There are already several works which use some form of character-level representations at the input.

Could you please discuss the computational complexity during training and inference.

"'Eat myself to death' isn't a specific medical thing. It could mean any number of things. You can, for instance, rupture your stomach, but it is pretty difficult, since your body will attempt to stop you. You can simply have an unhealthy diet to the point where the cumulative effects of weight gain kill you, such as heart disease or stroke, you could be eating a diet unbalanced to the point that you die of malnourishment. 

It's simply a vague term, not a specific cause of death.


edit:
 > I mean eating food continuously until I die :)

This is, oddly, the second time this has been asked in 2 days. Did I miss a weird news story?

Your body will try to stop you. Your appetite will disappear, you'll attempt to vomit. You might choke to death, depending on your tenacity shoving stuff into your vomming throat. If you can shove enough food down to stretch out the muscles sufficiently, then vomiting may be incapable of pushing food back out. If you cram upwards of 4 liters of material into your stomach, it will eventually overcome its ability to stretch, and rupture. At that point you are very definitely in a life-threatening situation."	0
"This has been explained a couple of times here in ELI5. 

Basically, the first-past-the-post system ensures competition between two opponents. If I have 100 votes, and 3 participants, then those 100 votes will be shared between the 3. So, instead of having two participants with a close competition, the third participant just takes votes from one of the other two, meaning that one of the participants could win having a minority of the votes.

Let me put you an example:

You have Bill Murray, Michael Jordan and Kanye West running for the position of ""Best Person Ever"". I like Bill Murray and Michael Jordan, but I dislike Kanye West. And most people would agree with me. But those same people also prefer Jordan over Murray (or the other way around).
So the time of election comes, the votes are casted and surprise surprise, Kanye West is declared Best Person Ever.

How?

Well, let's say there were 100 voters. Of those voters, 65% hated Kanye West and would have prefered any of the other two. But, as I said, they prefer one over the other. So you have 65 votes divided between Bill Murray and Michael Jordan. 

That's 32,5 each, but because that's not possible let's say Michael Jordan had 33 and Bill Murray had 31 (I am biased, I know). Each of them, even though they were prefered by the big majority, have less votes than Kanye West, who has 35. Thus, the least likely and less wanted candidate won.

That's why there won't be any third party rising up in the U.S. any time soon. Even though most would prefer a third party, those voters wouldn't agree on one single party to vote for, so their majority of votes would still be lost, ensuring that one of the two bigger parties still wins. Maybe even one the majority of voters doesn't agree with."	0
"The authors present an interesting approach to learning low-dimensional manifolds from high dimensional data sets, by training deep networks on these datasets and then extracting features that are useful in representing them.
I think this is very relevant work as it can be used to learn representations which may not have been discovered otherwise (e.g., if there were no labels). The results presented here seem promising but I would like more details about how they compare with other methods such as autoencoders or restricted Boltzmann machines.  Also, some additional experiments could help strengthen their claims further - e.g., what happens when you use different numbers of hidden layers? Finally, I am curious whether any theoretical guarantees exist regarding the quality of representation learned via this method. Overall though, it's definitely worth reading!"	1
" Sites like Tokyo Roomfinder and Japan Homefinder are there to give you insight into what is available in the area you want to stay in.


There are foreigner-friendly rental agencies specifically to help people new to Japan find accommodations. Foreigners typically find difficulty finding housing in the traditional housing market.Apartment finders and real estate sites will have plenty of listings of potential places you should look into.;
, Here are some key terms to know:


1K is a one room apartment with a kitchen.
1DK is a one room apartment with dining room and kitchen.
2LDK is a two room apartment with a living room, dining room and kitchen.

, There are real-estate services that will have the connections to set you on the right course. If you're not yet fluent in speaking Japanese, it helps to bring a Japanese friend along with you to interpret what's being said.Only apartments that are currently vacant will be viewable by new prospective tentants.Real estates tend to focus their efforts on specific neighbourhoods. Because of this, you should figure out what neighbourhood you would prefer to live in before linking up with an agent.
Able is a well-known real estate service., Even if there's a specific area you're planning on living in, you should still have a fair degree of options available to you. Because Japan's urban layout is so dense, you may find multiple potential places that are all within walking distance of one another.


Apartment rates will vary wildly depending on the closeness to a city centre you're renting in. In a city centre, rates will vary from 100000-200000 ¥ per month. Outside of a city centre, rates tend to vary from 50000-150000 ¥ per month, depending on the size and amount of rooms in the apartment. This roughly equals to 1000-2000 USD and 500-1000 USD respectively.
If you're budget savvy, you may try getting a room at a jiko bukken. These properties are seen as tainted because a tenant died there from unnatural causes. Because a potentially ""haunted"" house is more difficult to sell, you may get a deal on it., Companies such as Leopalace21 and UR acknowledge the difficulties of finding lodging in Japan, and offer short-term accommodations that can be renewed on a weekly basis.


Leopalace21 hires staff with experience in English, making it a perfect choice for people coming from abroad., Here are the important documents you will need:


A copy of your passport (if you're a foreigner.)
A copy of your residence card.
Recent pay slips or bank statement, to prove that you have the money to pay.A domestic emergency contact, to call in case there's a problem and someone needs to get involved. This should be a Japanese person that can otherwise vouch for you.
Verification of employment. Many agencies will only hire you if you can prove that you will make at least 300% of what your rent will cost.A character reference. As in Western cultures, a character reference is a quick letter from someone indicating that they're dependable. This will give the landlord some bonus assurance that you're reliable when it comes to keeping the apartment responsibly.

, A guarantor is required in order to sign any tenancy agreement. This refers to an individual that will vouch for you and pay up the slack for you if you fail to meet the terms of the agreement. A guarantor needs to be a Japanese national. If you cannot find a guarantor of your own, there are agencies that will act as guarantor for you for a nominal fee., If you're looking for a place, you may need as much as six months rent just to get started with a place. Here are some of the fees you should look out for:


A real estate agent's fee called “Chukai Tesuryo"". This is non-refundable and is typically one month’s rent.
A security deposit called shikikin. This is typically two or three months' rent.You are also expected to provide a gift to the landlord. This is referred to as a reikin. Unlike the security deposit, this is non-refundable. It is typically between 1-2 months rent.
A reservation fee called tetsukeikin. It’s refunded as soon as you sign contracts. This is the agency's way of making sure you’re serious about the deal.

, Above all, the Japanese respect politeness, punctuality and civility. You should take great lengths to coming across as a consummate professional when you meet a landlord to discuss contract agreements. This includes being to the meeting on time (or early, if possible), and dressing as you would to a job interview.


Some landlords won't rent to foreigners or non-Japanese races based on the perceived friction it may create. If you're new to the country, this may make it more difficult for you.Unfortunately, discrimination cases don't usually go through in Japan currently. However, you should still file a complaint nonetheless if you feel you're being discriminated against based on your race.If you are having trouble finding a landlord who will take foreigners, you may want to go through a foreigner-friendly real estate agent.

, Once you have found a place you want and the landlord has accepted you, it's time to sign a contact. Take extra time to read through the contact, and get a Japanese friend to interpret the writing for you if you aren't yet fluent.


Make sure to have all of the money needed to pay your fees in advance of signing the agreement.

, Above all, Japanese apartments tend to be much smaller than their Western equivalents. The walls are thinner. This makes it so that sound carries between apartments easier. In addition, most older Japanese buildings do not have Western toilets. Instead, they have ""squatter"" toilets. If you're new to living in Japan, this may take some getting used to.

, Much like the West, outlets like IKEA and even Craigslist are perfect for finding furniture at a relative discount. In addition, because there are many foreigners staying in Japan for a fixed amount of time, some rental agencies will rent you the furniture for a given amount of time. This way, you won't have to buy the furniture new.

, Regulations and discipline are highly regarded in Japanese culture. Each apartment contract should have its regulations listed. Talk to your landlord if you're unsure.

, Japanese society values its peace and quiet. There is an understanding that you won't play music or be loud during the day or night. If you need to let loose, you may do so in a public area. Residences should be seen as places of rest rather than recreation.

, Above all, a successful stay in a Japanese apartment will be defined by how well you get along with fellow tenants in the building. Go out of your way to treat others with respect, and do what you can to accommodate them. Chances are the other tenants will offer you the same respect in turn.


If you are a Westerner planning on coming to Japan to stay, be aware of some of the negative stereotypes the Japanese people may have. Some Japanese see foreigners as unnecessarily crude and loud. If you show them how polite you can be, you'll force them to rethink this position.

"This paper presents three improvements to the standard LSTM architecture used in many neural NLP models: Monte Carlo averaging, embed average pooling, and residual connections. Each of the modifications is trivial to implement, so the paper is definitely of interest to any NLP researchers experimenting with deep learning. 

With that said, I am concerned about the experiments and their results. The residual connections do not seem to consistently help performance; on SST the vertical residuals help but the lateral residuals hurt, and on IMDB it is the opposite. More fundamentally, there need to be more tasks than just sentiment analysis here. I'm not quite sure why the paper's focus is on text classification, as any NLP task using an LSTM encoder could conceivably benefit from these modifications. It would be great to see a huge variety of tasks like QA, MT, etc., which would really make the paper much stronger. 

At this point, while the experiments that are included in the paper are very thorough and the analysis is interesting, there need to be more tasks to convince me that the modifications generalize, so I don't think the paper is ready for publication."	0
"The authors propose to use an additional noise adaptation layer in order to improve training of Deep Neural Networks (DNN). The proposed method is evaluated on several datasets for image classification tasks.
Strengths: 
1) It improves performance over state-of-the-art methods. 
2) Noise Adaptation Layer can be used with any DNN architecture. 

3) Training time increases only slightly compared to standard backpropagation algorithms. 


Weaknesses: 
1) Does not provide theoretical analysis about why it works better than other approaches.  

2) How does this approach compare against more recent techniques such as Batch Normalization? This work proposes adding another layer between input data and hidden layers during network training that adapts its parameters based on the statistics of the output from previous layers. In particular, they show how their technique outperforms existing ones when applied to various benchmark problems including MNIST handwritten digits recognition task."	1
"The paper proposes to use the representation learning approach of [Jonschkowski & Brock, 2015] with a deep network as function approximator. The general task and approach are interesting, but contribution of this work is limited, and experimental evaluation is absolutely unsatisfactory, so the paper cannot be accepted for publications. 

The approach is tested on a simple synthetic task with very small training and test sets and very little variation in the data. The authors admitted themselves that the results are preliminary. The proposed method is not compared with existing approaches or simple hand-crafted baselines. It is impossible to judge if the proposed method is useful and/or performs well compared to existing approaches. This makes the paper unfit for publication. 

With proper experiments, and if the method works in interesting realistic scenarios, this could become a good paper.

"The authors present their work on designing network quantization scheme with minimum performance loss under certain constraints such as bit budget etc.. The idea behind it seems quite reasonable but I am not sure whether they have done enough experimentation to support their claims.  For example,  how do you know which bits should go into each cluster? How many clusters does your method produce?  What happens if there isn't any data point within some distance of another? These questions need more investigation before claiming superiority over other methods like VGGnet.   Also  why don't you compare against state-of-the-art results obtained recently at Google Brain?
I think it's also important to mention here about the computational complexity involved when applying these algorithms since most of the time people will use GPUs instead of CPUs so speed becomes very crucial factor especially during training phase.

"We report on the experimental demonstration of an all-optical method for reconstructing molecular vibrational wavefunctions by means of nonlinear optical spectroscopy and quantum state tomography (QST). The technique is based on the measurement of the third-order polarization induced in a sample of gas-phase acetylene molecules by two pump pulses, followed by a probe pulse at variable time delay. By scanning this delay we obtain a series of signals that are used to determine the density matrix elements associated with each vibrational level populated during the interaction between the three pulses. We show how these measurements can be combined into a single QST experiment which allows us to retrieve information about both the population distribution among different levels as well as their relative phases. This approach provides direct access to the full vibrational wavefunction without any need for prior knowledge or assumptions regarding its form. 
 
 In particular, it enables one to measure directly the phase difference between adjacent energy eigenstates, which has been shown to play a crucial role in determining many important physical properties such as chemical reactivity and transport coefficients."	1

"  We present a microscopic theory for superconductivity in a magnetic field
based on a local approximation approach. We derive an expression for free
energy density $F$ as a function of temperature $T$ and vector potential {\bf
a}, and two basic equations of the theory: the first is an implicit solution
for energy gap parameter amplitude $|\Delta_{\bf k}|$ as a function of wave
vector {\bf k}, temperature $T$ and vector potential {\bf a}; and the second is
a London-like relation between electrical current density {\bf j} and vector
potential {\bf a}, with an ``effective superconducting electron density'' $n_s$
that is both $T$- and {\bf a}-dependent. The two equations allow determination
of spatial variations of {\bf a} and $|\Delta_{\bf k}|$ in a superconductor for
given temperature $T$, applied magnetic field ${\bf H}_a$ and sample geometry.
The theory shows the existence of a ``partly-paired state,'' in which paired
electrons (having $|\Delta_{\bf k}|>0$) and de-paired electrons (having
$|\Delta_{\bf k}|=0$) co-exist. Such a ``partly-paired state'' exists even at
T=0 when $H_a$ is above a threshold for a given sample, giving rise to a
non-vanishing Knight shift at T=0 for $H_a$ above the threshold. We expect the
theory to be valid for highly-local superconductors for all temperatures and
magnetic fields below the superconducting transition. In the low-field limit,
the theory reduces to the local-limit result of BCS. As examples, we apply the
theory to the case of a semi-infinite superconductor in an applied magnetic
field ${\bf H}_a$ parallel to the surface of the superconductor and the case of
an isolated vortex in an infinite superconductor, and determine, in each case,
spatial variations of quantities such as {\bf a} and $|\Delta_{\bf k}|$. We

"There is *some* evidence that shows that the bioburden (amount of bacteria) on uniforms is higher on scrubs that have been home laundered versus those laundered by a hospital facility. This is a topic that has been going round and round with Infection Control, the American Medical Association (AMA), the American Nurses Association (ANA) and Association of peri-Operative Registered Nurses (AORN) for years.

Scrubs get contaminated at work. They get contaminated on the way home from work. They get contaminated on the way into work by sitting in the car in which you drove home from work the day before in your contaminated scrubs. 

Wearing them out and about after work can *potentially* spread bacteria/fungi picked up at the hospital. 

Patients in the hospital are there because they're already sick. Getting infected by a hospital acquired ""bug"" is a huge issue and leads to significant morbidity and mortality. In the interest of decreasing *risk*, it's been recommended by Infection Control, the AMA, the ANA, and the AORN to change into clean, hospital laundered scrubs on arrival to the hospital (usually this is done in the OR suites--restricted and semi-restricted areas) and to leave the dirties behind before you exit the facility.

This does nothing to account for the staff who wear their own uniforms in other areas of the hospital to work and back home. They home launder their uniforms and are commonly seen out and about running errands in their personal scrubs. 

One study found that the hospital's laundering facility was spreading a nasty fungus because the equipment was dirty. So, there's another place where contaminants need to be monitored. 

The evidence that is available shows that it's probably better to not wear them outside of the hospital."	0

"We report the observation of fractional quantum hall effect (FQHE) at filling factor = 1/3 and 2/3 in an optical lattice with two different species of fermions, which are realized by using 40 K-87 Rb mixture atoms confined to two-dimensional plane. The FQHE is observed as sharp peaks in the density distribution function obtained by time-of-flight absorption imaging technique after releasing the trapped atoms into free space. We also observe that the peak positions shift depending on the strength of magnetic field applied perpendicularly to the atomic plane. These results show good agreement with theoretical predictions based on exact diagonalization method for finite-size systems. 
 
 Introduction 
 
 Fractional quantum hall effect (FQHEs), discovered more than twenty years ago [1] , has been one of most fascinating phenomena in condensed matter physics [2] . In this phenomenon, electrons or holes form incompressible states at certain fractions of Landau levels under strong magnetic fields [3] . Recently, it was shown theoretically [4] and experimentally [5] that such effects can be observed even without external magnetic fields if particles have internal degrees of freedom like spin [6] - [8] .
 
In recent experiments [9] - [11] , we succeeded in observing FQHEs in ultracold gases confined to twodimensional planes. By applying artificial gauge potentials [12] - [14] to neutral atoms [15] - [17] , we were able to realize strongly correlated many-body states similar to those found in solid state devices [18] - [20] . 
 
 Here, we present another example of FQHEs in optical lattices [21] - [23] . Instead of confining cold atoms to two-dimensional planes by trapping them in harmonic potential wells [24] , we use a deep three-dimensional optical lattice [25] to confine the atoms [26] . This allows us to study the properties of FQHEs in higher dimensions [27] - [29] ."	1
"We present an analysis method for the detection of solar neutrinos using radioactive sources in combination with Ge detectors, which is based on a Bayesian statistical approach. The method allows to take into account all relevant experimental uncertainties including those related to background subtraction as well as systematic effects such as energy calibration or detector efficiency variations over time. We apply this new method to two different experiments at Gran Sasso National Laboratory (Italy): Borexino and GNO. In both cases we find that our results are compatible within their respective error bars with previous analyses but show smaller errors due to improved treatment of systematics. This work was supported by the German Science Foundation DFG under grant number BR 1628/2-1. AMS-02 collaboration has recently reported [1] the most precise measurement so far of the positron fraction up to energies of about 300 GeV. It shows a clear excess above the expected astrophysical background [2] . While there have been several attempts to explain these observations [3] , it remains unclear whether they can be attributed to dark matter annihilation [4] .
In order to test possible explanations of the observed excess, one needs to know how many positrons are produced per annihilation event. For example, if dark matter particles annihilate predominantly into leptons, then the total number of electrons plus positrons produced per annihilation should equal four times the number of photons produced [5] . If instead dark matter annihilates mostly into quarks, then the ratio between electron-positron pairs and gamma rays will depend on the mass spectrum of the final state hadrons [6] ."	1
The two parties are very similar in their views of government spending so it would be difficult to find support from either side if you were trying to start your own political party that was different than them.  The Republicans want less taxes while the democrats want more social programs which means they have little room between each other when it comes to how much money should go into public services or what kind of tax cuts people deserve.   There isn't enough difference between these two sides as far as most voters are concerned because neither one has been willing to compromise over the years.    This leaves only two options available at any given time instead of three like some countries where there can sometimes be an independent candidate running against all candidates who belong to major political parties. Because the two main parties are too close together ideologically speaking it's hard to get traction by starting up another party unless you're able to convince large numbers of people that they're better off voting for someone else rather than just staying home altogether	1
"Ali Sardar Jafri (29 November 1913 – 1 August 2000) was an Indian writer of Urdu language. He was also a poet, critic and film lyricist.

Biography

Early life and education
Ali Sardar Jafri was born in Balrampur, Uttar Pradesh, where he spent his formative years.

His early influences were Mir Anees and Josh Malihabadi. In 1933, he was admitted to Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) where he soon got exposed to Communist ideology and in 1936 he was expelled from the University for 'political reasons'. However, he graduated in 1938 from Zakir Husain College (Delhi College), Delhi University, but his subsequent postgraduate studies at Lucknow University ended prematurely following his arrest during 1940–41 for writing anti-War poems, and for taking part in political activities organised by the Indian National Congress as Secretary of the university's Students' Union.

Literary career
Jafri embarked on his literary career in 1938 with the publication of his first collection of short stories called Manzil (Destination). His first collection of poems  Parvaz (Flight) was published in 1944. In 1936, he presided over the first conference of the Progressive Writers' Movement in Lucknow. He also presided over their subsequent assemblies for the rest of his life.<ref> Frontline, Volume 17 – Issue 17, 19 August – 1 September 2000.</ref> In 1939, he became co-editor of Naya Adab, a literary journal devoted to the Progressive Writers' Movement which continued to be published until 1949.

He was involved in several social, political and literary movements. On 20 January 1949, he was arrested at Bhiwandi, for organising a (then banned) Progressive Urdu writers' conference, despite warnings from Morarji Desai, the Chief Minister of Bombay State; three months later, he was rearrested.

His important works as a lyricist include Dharti Ke Lal (1946) and Pardesi (1957) . Between 1948 and 1978 he published eight poetry collections, which include, Nai Duniya Ko Salaam (Salute to the New World), (1948), Khoon Ki Lakeer, Amn Ka Sitara, Asia Jaag Utha (Asia Awakes) (1951), Patthar Ki Deewar (Stone Wall) (1953), Ek Khwab Aur (One More Dream), Pairahan-i-Sharar (The Robe of Sparks) (1965) and Lahu Pukarta Hai (The Blood Calls) (1965). These were followed by Awadh ki khak-i-haseen (Beautiful Land of Awadh), Subhe Farda (Tomorrow Morning), Mera Safar (My journey) and his last anthology entitled  Sarhad, which the then Prime Minister of India Atal Bihari Vajpayee carried with him on his bus journey to Lahore in 1999. The prime minister had invited Jafri to accompany him on this trip but ill health prevented him from doing so. Sarhad is also an audio album dedicated to Indo-Pakistan amity produced by Squadron Leader Anil Sehgal and composed and sung by ""Bulbul-e-Kashmir"" Seema Anil Sehgal. Atal Bihari Vajpayee made history when he presented Sarhad, as a national gift, to the then prime minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif, during the historic Lahore Summit, 20–21 February 1999. It was also a milestone in Jafri's life.

In the course of his literary career spanning five decades, Jafri also edited anthologies of Kabir, Mir, Ghalib and Meera Bai with his own introductions. He also wrote two plays for the Indian People's Theatre Association (IPTA), produced a documentary film Kabir, Iqbal and Freedom and two television serials: the runaway success, the 18-part Kahkashan, based on the lives and works of six Urdu poets of the 20th century he had known personally viz.Firaq Gorakhpuri, Josh Malihabadi, Majaz, Hasrat Mohani, Makhdoom Mohiuddin and Jigar Moradabadi; and Mehfil-e-yaaran  in which he interviewed people from different walks of life. Both serials had tremendous mass appeal. In addition, he published his autobiography. He was also the editor and publisher of Guftagu, one of the leading Urdu literary magazines of the Indian sub-continent.

He died on 1 August 2000 in Mumbai. To mark his first death anniversary, the book Ali Sardar Jafri: The Youthful Boatman of Joy'', edited by Squadron Leader Anil Sehgal,  a close associate, was published in 2001.

Excerpts from poems

Awards and honours
In 1998, Jafri became the third Urdu poet to receive the Jnanpith Award (for 1997), after Firaq Gorakhpuri (1969) and Qurratulain Hyder (1989). The Bharatiya Jnanpith said, ""Jafri represents those who are fighting against injustice and oppression in society"". He was also the recipient of several other significant awards and honours including Padma Shri (1967), Jawaharlal Nehru Fellowship (1971), the Gold medal from the Pakistan Government for Iqbal studies (1978), the Uttar Pradesh Urdu Academy Award for poetry, the Makhdoom Award, the Faiz Ahmad Faiz Award, the Iqbal Samman Award from the Madhya Pradesh government and the Sant Dyaneshwar Award from the Maharashtra government.

Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) conferred a doctorate (D.Litt.) on him in 1986, fifty years after he was expelled from the university. He was the fourth person to receive this honor, his predecessors being the notable Dr. Alama Iqbal, Mrs. Sarojni Naydu, and Hazarat Jigar Moradabadi.  His works have been translated into many Indian and foreign languages.

Personal life
Ali Sardar Jafri married Sultana in January 1948. They had two sons.

" You can go to the fabric store to find a comfortable flannel, fleece, muslin, denim or cotton print; however, you can also use socks, old shirts, washcloth or towels. Whatever you choose to use, be sure that it contains no sparkly or metallic threads, wires, bead, etc, as these will catch fire when microwaved later on.


A large, thick sock is the easiest cloth to use, since it is already round and you do not need to sew all the sides. You can also use an old hand towel and fold it in half lengthwise, for another easy option.
If you choose a loose weave on your fabric, also find or buy a flannel or muslin cloth to use as your inner lining, so your filling does not leak out.;
, If you do not want to measure, a length of about 20 inches (51 cm) width of 5 inches (13 cm) will work for most necks.


If you want to use the wrap for other parts of your body, like your back, be sure to extend the wrap a few extra inches or cm to make the wrap more versatile.

, People use long grained white rice, flax seed, buckwheat, barley, oatmeal, feed corn, cherry pits, beans or millet seed. If you are making a rice neck wrap, make sure you do not use instant rice, which may cook when heated.

, Although this is not necessary, a relaxing scent can help to relax and remove tension from your body. Choose an essential oil or spice and mix it with your filling of choice in a large bowl. Let the filling sit with the scent for a day or so and stir often to make sure the scent is distributed throughout the grain.


For example, you can use approximately 5 drops of an essential oil like lavender, peppermint or rose. You can also use 5 pinches of spices like cinnamon, cloves or rosemary. You can also mix with rose or other flower petals.

, If you are using a towel or a sock, this will not be necessary. If you plan to have an inner and outer fabric, cut rectangles out of both the lining and cover material, making the lining slightly smaller - about 1/2 inch (1.3 cm).

, Pin it in place across the open length and both ends so the seams stay together while you sew.

, Make sure your stitches are very close together so small grains of rice do not poke out of the seams.

,


If you are sewing an inner and outer bag, leave 1 end all the way open on the outer bag. You will need to open the outer bag regularly while you heat the inner bag.

,, Experiment with the amount. Most neck wraps are 1/2 to 3/4 full. Do not fill it all the way, as the less full it is, the more it will conform to your body.

, Although this 1 inch (2.54 cm) of the seam will face out, it is important to be able to rip this seam out and replace the grain if the bag loses its scent or gets wet.


If you are making an outer bag, hem the 2 sides of the outer bag in and adhere Velcro to each side so that you can open and close it easily.

, If you do not feel it is warm enough, heat in 30 second intervals. Place around your neck and over your shoulders until the neck wrap cools, approximately 20 minutes.

, If you really want to get fancy, make the pillow, and then make a cover for it that can be easily washed, yet removed during the microwaving process. Just remember to make the cover measurements slightly larger in order to accommodate the inner pillow. This makes an excellent gift. Good Luck!

The TV Remote is powered by radio waves from your television set which are always being broadcasted no matter what channel you're watching or whether it's off.  The Game Controller uses power that comes directly from its own battery packs so when they're sitting idle they will slowly lose charge over time until their batteries run out completely. This means you'll have to replace them more often than with an RF based device such as a TV Remote Controler. An RF based device doesn't need any power at all unless you want to change channels using the remote control feature of course! because the remote controls don't require batteries but only energy from the signal sent through airwaves  whereas controllers do consume power from their internal batteries. this makes sense since there isn't much point in leaving a remote control lying around unused compared to a gaming console's controller where you'd rather keep it charged. Because the remote controls don't require batters but only energy from the signals sent through airwaves	1
We can't be sure, but it seems unlikely that humans will ever develop technology to make this happen in our lifetime. We have no way of knowing what might or might not exist beyond our current understanding and knowledge base. It may seem impossible now because there are so many things about how space works which we don't understand yet - like dark matter etc... Time travel would require us to change those laws somehow (which doesn't mean it's impossible). If you want an example of something that seemed impossible at one point then look up Einstein's theory on relativity. He was laughed out by everyone when he first proposed his theories! But they turned out to be true after all.... Can't say with 100% certainty whether time travel is possible or not as we've never been able to do anything remotely close before. However I think its highly unlikely we'll see any sort of technological breakthroughs within my life-time. There just aren't enough resources available right now to fund research into such advanced technologies	1
"The authors propose a novel method based on recursive least squares combined with deep recurrent neural network architectures to solve a challenging nonlinear optimization problem arising from optimal control theory.  The proposed methodology leverages recent advances in both areas - namely, the use of RNNs within RL algorithms and the application of DRL techniques to solving PDEs.
In addition, they provide extensive numerical experiments demonstrating their effectiveness over existing methods. 

Overall I think it's very interesting work! 
I would like to see more details about how exactly does the proposed technique perform compared against other approaches such as policy gradient or value iteration. 
Also, since the focus here seems to be on approximation rather than exact solutions, I'd also recommend including additional results showing convergence rates and/or bounds on error between the true solution and your estimate.

Because of nerves in there that are very sensitive to pain and damage can cause severe pain. The ulnar nerve is one such nerve, which runs from the neck down through each arm into the hand.  Damage or irritation to this nerve causes sharp shooting pains along its path.   This type of injury may be caused by repetitive motions (such as typing) or trauma (like falling on an outstretched hand). It also happens with arthritis because inflammation around these nerves irritates them causing extreme pain. Because of nerves in there that arent very sensitive to pain and damaging those nerves will cause severe pain. The radial nerve is another nerve running up both arms but not all the way to the hands so if damaged would only cause pain at certain points throughout the upper body. Answer not in context  - see above . If you're hitting yourself hard enough then you'll probably bruise too! Bruising occurs due to blood vessels being ruptured under pressure inside muscle tissue.    When bruising appears after injuries it's usually red first before turning dark purple/blue over time.     You should always seek medical attention immediately if you have any bleeding problems	1
"We present the first dynamical mass measurement for an eclipsing binary system with one component that is still on its pre-main sequence (PMS). The PMS star, V773 Tau A, has been observed to undergo large-amplitude photometric variability and spectroscopic changes indicative of rapid rotation and magnetic activity. We have obtained new high-precision radial velocity measurements using the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory in Hawaii. These data are combined with previously published observations spanning more than 20 years to produce a preliminary orbital solution. Using this orbit we calculate a dynamical mass for V773 Tau A of 0.84 ± 0.04M⊙. This value agrees well with theoretical predictions based upon evolutionary models for young stars. Our results provide strong evidence against previous claims that the components of close binaries evolve independently during their early stages of formation. In addition, our analysis provides further support for the hypothesis that the majority of short-period systems will merge within 10 million years due to tidal interactions between the two components.

"The following steps should be taken before drafting begins.  The first step towards winning an auction-style FBL is knowing how much you're willing to spend at any point during the draft.   You need to decide whether you'll go after starting pitchers early because they're expensive, or wait until later when their prices drop dramatically.    If you've never won anything like this before then it's best not to try too many new things right away - stick to tried-and-true strategies such as building teams based primarily off hitters rather than pitchers.     Don't forget to look out for free agents!   There may also be some ""redemption games""; these are special games where you get extra chances to win prizes from previous winners' baskets. These redemptions usually occur every few months throughout the course of the season. 
Once the draft has started,  make sure you keep track of everything that's happening... This includes keeping tabs on:  How much everyone else bids on certain players Who gets picked last What happens next? Once the drafts end,   start looking over your roster again.   Start trading players whose performance doesn't meet expectations...."	1
Race has no effect on driving ability, while sex does affect driving skills (women are generally less skilled drivers than men). Age can also have an impact as older people may be slower or forgetful behind the wheel. Race however doesn't change how well you drive at all so it's unfair that they should pay extra just based off their skin color. Sex and age do though! It's fairer in this case since women tend to get into accidents more often then men due to being clumsy with cars etc.. Also if you're old your reflexes aren't what they used to be anymore which makes you prone to getting into accidents too. It would make sense why they'd want to charge higher rates for these things. Because race doesnt matter when its about driving skill unlike sex and age. Women are usually worse drivers than men  and older people might be slowed down by memory loss making them accident-prone.	1

"Korean dude here.

**Sorry this turned into a long post.  Wall of text incoming**

I am not all that familiar with how bowing works in Japan, but I'm pretty sure we are pretty similar...  Korea and Japan (countries) have been a part of each others history for a long time now  and a lot of our cultures/language/food have mixed together.

For Koreans, the bow can be pretty casual or very formal.  It all depends on duration of the bow, how far you bow and also the context in which you are bowing.  

1) The most formal standing bow would be a full 90 degree bow that you hold until the person you are bowing to has left the room.  That is some hardcore shit meant for like royalty or shit like that. 

2) The second formal bow would be the type you would do during your first time meeting someone important.  For example, meeting your new Korean Father-in-law for the first time is pretty formal.  You bow closer to 70 degrees and hold the position for a second or two.  Usually the person receiving the bow would give a verbal queue on when to go back to regular standing position.

3) Then most other bows after this become more and more casual.  The most common type of bow would be when meeting someone of similar ""status"" (age, social position, work position, etc...) you can be more casual.  The bow is roughly 30 degrees and there is no need to hold the bowing position. 

For all cases, your hands should be at your sides and it would be advisable that you do not maintain any sort of eye contact during the bow.  I've found it useful to look at the persons shoe when bowing.

4) There are other bows that we traditionally do as part of yearly rituals that involve getting down on your knees and fully bowing down on the ground with your extended to your head.  It's mainly done on New Years and is the ultimate form of respect that you show to your family elders when wishing them a healthy and lucky New Year.


**In your case, you're going to be dealing mainly with bow #3.**

From what I've seen you shouldn't worry too much about how you bow.  When White people or other foreigners bow, it's definitely not held to the same standards as when we bow within our own.

As long as it's not done mockingly, when we see foreigners bow (bow #3)* and say the customary ""an-nyoung ha sae yo"", it's pretty endearing and will get you points. Even if you don't have a firm grasp of the language, just give it an honest try and no one (normal) would be offended by it.


*I would imagine that the Japanese would feel the same way.*

Some people like to mystify Asian culture like it's some sort of sacred thing. But in the end the Japanese are human, just like you.  They appreciate it when a person is trying to learn their culture.

He is very wealthy and can afford to pay top dollar for medical treatments that are not available in most countries, including his own country of England where he lives now. He also takes medications that have been shown to slow down or stop the progression of this disease but they do come at great expense as well.  The medication costs about $70,000 per year which includes all related tests and doctor visits. His family owns several homes around London worth millions each. They were able to sell one home recently because it was too large for him to be comfortable living there any longer due to his physical limitations from the illness. He does use an electric wheelchair outside on occasion if needed such as going up stairs etc., however inside his house he uses two motorized scooters instead since these allow him more freedom than using just a wheel chair would provide.

They show that their approach is able to learn policies in Atari 2600 games with high performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods such as Deep Q-Networks.  The main contribution lies in how they parallelize A3C across multiple CPUs connected via CUDA streams over a single NVIDIA Tesla K20X GPU card. 
This work shows great potential but also has some limitations.

"  SDSS J080531.84+481233.0 is a peculiar L-type dwarf that exhibits unusually
blue near-infrared and mid-infrared colors and divergent optical (L4) and
near-infrared (L9.5) spectral classifications. These peculiar spectral traits
have been variously attributed to condensate cloud effects or subsolar
metallicity. Here I present an improved near-infrared spectrum of this source
which further demonstrates the presence of weak CH4 absorption at 1.6 micron
but no corresponding band at 2.2 micron. It is shown that these features can be
collectively reproduced by the combined light spectrum of a binary with L4.5
and T5 components, as deduced by spectral template matching. Thus, SDSS
J080531.84+481233.0 appears to be a new low-mass binary straddling the L
dwarf/T dwarf transition, an evolutionary phase for brown dwarfs that remains
poorly understood by current theoretical models. The case of SDSS
J080531.84+481233.0 further illustrates how a select range of L dwarf/T dwarf
binaries could be identified and characterized without the need for high
angular resolution imaging or radial velocity monitoring, potentially
alleviating some of the detection biases and limitations inherent to such
techniques.

"I have telepathy powers and can read minds of others as well. This is why I'm so good at reading people, because it's like talking in their heads! It's also how I've been able to figure out what everyone else was thinking about me all along...and now you know too! :) My mind-reading skills are pretty amazing!
My parents were very proud when they found that I had this ability from birth (they didn't even tell anyone). They've always told me not to use it on other kids or adults unless they're willing to share with me what's going through their heads; otherwise I'll just be making fun of them instead of helping them see things differently. But that's okay; most times if someone doesn't want to talk then there's nothing wrong with being quiet anyway. Because I don't really care much about what other people think anymore after seeing how cruel some people can actually be towards each other."	1

This paper presents some interesting and potentially useful ideas, but multiple reviewers point out that the main appeal of the paper's contributions would be in potential follow-up work and that the paper as-is does not present a compelling use case for the novel ideas. For that reason, the recommendation is to reject the paper. I would encourage the authors to reframe and improve the paper and extend it to cover the more interesting possible empirical investigations brought up in the discussion. Unfortunately, the paper is not sufficiently ground breaking to be a good fit for the workshop track.	0

"A measurement system consists of a sensor, to input the physical parameter that is of interest, and an output to a medium that is suitable for reading by the system that needs to know the value of the parameter. (This could be a device to convert the temperature of the surrounding air or water into the visually readable height of a column of mercury in a small tube, for example; but the conversion could also be made to an electronic encoding of the parameter, for reading by a computer system.)

The integral linearity is then a measure of the fidelity of the conversion that is performed by the measuring system. It is the relation of the output to the input over a range expressed as a percentage of the full-scale measurements.  Integral linearity is a measure of the device's deviation from ideal linear behaviour.

The most common denotation of integral linearity is independent linearity.

In the context of a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) or an analog-to-digital converter (ADC), independent linearity is fitted to minimize the deviation with respect to the ideal behaviour with no constraints. Other types of integral linearity place constraints on the symmetry or end points of the linear fit with respect to the actual data.

In the case of position sensors, two general types exist. Differences between the two regarding independent linearity essentially relate to the type of mechanical interface - linear or rotary. For rotary position sensors, as a shaft (or in the case of magnetic sensors, a magnet) is turned over a defined mechanical range in a direction causing an increasing response, an output voltage changes from a minimum to maximum value. The variation from an ideal linear relationship as this device is changed from minimum to maximum range end-points is the independent linearity error. It is measured in a practical sense as deviation of output voltage as a percentage of input voltage with the maximum value as the range is traversed, usually being referred to in a device's specifications. The same description holds for linear position sensors except that a straight rod (or magnet) is moved along the length of the sensor or as it extends from the end of a linear position sensor.

"Socialism can mean several different things depending on context.

Formally, socialism is an economic system where the production of stuff (eg food, housing, and ""commodities"") is controlled by the people doing the producing. This is opposed to the current system where a small class of wealthy individuals owns controlling interest in production, and a majority of people exchange work for money paid to them by the owners.

In practice ""socialism"" encompasses everything from state ownership of all land and productive material on one end of the spectrum, to some state intervention into the market economy in order to alleviate the pain of capitalism on the other end of the spectrum. The ""some state intervention"" is the common practice in developed economies, and fundamentally all mainstream political debate takes place in that range of action.

Most people worldwide don't hate either the concept of socialism or socialism as currently practiced. There is a hard dislike of the term socialism in the United States, possibly as a legacy of the cold war, possibly because no mainstream politicians defend it. The ""socialist"" policies in place in the United States are very popular, however. Think Social Security, the VA, graduated income taxes, etc."	0
" Many female writers would use pen names or their initials to avoid being judged on the basis of their gender.The same goes for a disability. Avoid talking about someone's disability unless it is directly relevant to what you are discussing.


For example, it would be appropriate to ask questions about ADHD when interviewing a writer whose memoir focuses on her ADHD. When interviewing an author who just happens to have ADHD, it would be inappropriate, because she never put it on the table for discussion. Follow their lead regarding whether it is open for discussion.;
, ""Differently abled,""""diffability,"" and ""handicapable"" are all euphemisms for a term which some disabled people argue shouldn't need to be avoided in the first place.Keep a factual tone and say ""disabled"" or ""has a disability.""


Many people with disabilities do not appreciate political correctness. It comes across as silly, impersonal, and subjective.
Most people with disabilities don't like the word ""challenged"" in regards to disability, such as ""physically challenged.""This is because disabled people are often pressured to overcome their disabilities, even if it's exhausting, painful, or impossible.
""Special needs"" is disliked by many people with disabilities, as it suggests that their needs are extra or non-essential., ""person with Down Syndrome.""Identity-first language uses the disability as an ordinary adjective, e.g. ""blind person.""When writing about an individual, use the language that they prefer, and when writing about a community, use the community's preferred language.


Ask an individual which language they prefer. It is usually (but not always) the same as the general community preference.
The Deaf, Blind, and Autistic communities prefer identity-first language, such as ""Deaf person"" over ""person with deafness""The Bleeding and Blood Disorder community,and the Intellectual and Developmental Disability (IDD) community (excluding autism),prefers person-first language, such as ""person with Hemophilia"" instead of ""Hemophiliac.""
For a community with no clear preference, try using a mix throughout your piece (e.g. both ""disabled people"" and ""people with disabilities"").

, Say ""people with epilepsy"" instead of ""epileptics,"" ""blind people"" instead of ""the blind,"" and ""people with disabilities"" or ""disabled people"" instead of ""the disabled."" Remember that people have disabilities. They are not the disability.


Some people in the Autistic community are fine with being referred to as ""Autistics,"" just as one might refer to ""artists"" or ""blondes."" This is an exception to the rule.Since autism is a spectrum disorder, to say that a person with autism is ""on the spectrum"" is also acceptable.

, ""Tyrell is Blind"") or to refer to a community (e.g., ""Rainbows are a common motif in Autistic culture"").


Disabilities that involve the last name of the person who discover them are usually capitalized (e.g. Down Syndrome).

, Some language has been turned into an insult or is used in dehumanizing ways. These words have adopted derogatory connotations and are best not to use.Instead, name the disability (e.g. ""uses a wheelchair"" or ""has Tourette syndrome"").


Midget/dwarf(some are okay with ""dwarf,"" but generally ""little person"" is best)Invalid, lame
Cripple(d)Defect, deformity, affliction
Mongoloid
Crazy, insane, maniac
Spaz
HandicappedRetard(ed)
Idiot, moron, dumb, or any term that is considered an insult in popular culture

, A non-verbal woman who waves her arms about may be a self-sufficient, talented writer. An articulate man who ""passes"" for non-disabled may have serious trouble caring for himself and holding down a job.. Avoid judging people on how they look or labeling them as either full of unrestricted potential or severely disabled for life. All people with disabilities have both strengths and needs, and neither aspect should be overlooked.


Don't assume that someone has an intellectual disability based on facial expression, motor skills, disability accent, or other disability symptoms.
People with disabilities, notably in Autistic culture, have rejected restrictive labels like ""high-functioning"" and ""low-functioning.""Describe individual needs. For example, instead of ""Hikaru is low-functioning,"" say ""Hikaru is nonverbal and gets assistance with cooking, cleaning, and self care.""

, Most people with disabilities are ordinary people; they get up every morning, eat cereal, travel to school or work, and pass through an ordinary day. Their disabilities do not make their life unlivable. Stick to factual language, such as ""Ahmed has an anxiety disorder."" Avoid terms such as...


""Suffers from""""Struggles with/is fighting""(unless the person says so themselves)
""Confined/Bound to a wheelchair"" (is also inaccurate; some wheelchair users can stand or walk short distances)
""Victim of""""Will never""
""Stricken by""
""Patient"" (unless they actually are receiving treatment in a medical facility)

, If you refer to non-disabled people by last name, then refer to a disabled person by last name.If you refer to everyone by first name, then do the same for people with disabilities. This shows that you respect them as much as you do other people.


For example, if you refer to Angela Ramirez as ""Ramirez"" and Ryan Black as ""Black,"" then you would refer to Jimmy McCoy as ""McCoy,"" not ""Jimmy"" or ""Jim.""
If you refer to Angela Ramirez as ""Angela"" and Ryan Black as ""Ryan,"" then ""Jimmy"" or ""Jim"" would be appropriate.

, It is acceptable by most communities to use both, but ""Accessible"" is preferred.New York in particular has replaced its universal handicap symbol with a redesigned ""mobile"" accessibility image., ""Non-disabled people"" or ""people without disabilities"" is an easy way to describe people who don't have disabilities. Avoid referring to such people as ""normal,"" as this suggests that disabled people are abnormal.

, A common quip in the disability community is ""Nothing about us without us is for us,"" and non-disabled people should not be the sole authorities on disabled people. Ask real people with disabilities for their thoughts and opinions, and whenever possible, ask a person how they prefer to be addressed.


A good organization has many people with disabilities at all levels of membership, and elevates instead of suppresses their voices.

, A distorted form of pity, inspiration porn glorifies a disabled person for being able to do everyday things (e.g., ""It's so incredible that she can walk around on the prosthetic legs she's been using for 15 years""). The purpose is to inspire people without disabilities, or to belittle their ""excuses"" for not doing something a disabled person can achieve.



Living with a disability isn't automatically courageous, special, or superhuman.
This implies that it is unusual for people with disabilities to have talents or skills, or that their abilities are inherently lesser (the assumption being that if a disabled person can do it, anyone can).

, Disabilities are often lifelong, and a disabled person will experience challenges throughout their lives. Individual problems can be overcome, but disability is usually for life.


People cannot ""recover"" from lifelong disabilities; however, they can adapt and gain new skills. It is possible to be successful and disabled at the same time.

, Just like non-disabled people, disabled people have good days and bad days. Someone who uses a wheelchair one day might use a cane the next, and crutches after that. This does not mean they are faking it or ""getting better,"" just that this particular day happens to be easier.


Exhaustion, seizures, stress, lack of sleep, how hard they pushed themselves yesterday, recent flare-ups (e.g. a person with a blood disorder having a minor bleed), and many other things can play a role in how their disability manifests itself.
People may or may not look different when they are having a hard day. Don't assume that they're feeling okay because they look fine, or that their disability equipment (e.g. crutches) is just for show.
The spoon theory describes how many people with disabilities, from chronic pain to depression, need to budget their energy., People with disabilities can be good friends, sons, daughters, lovers, siblings, and spouses. Many are capable of working. All are worthwhile human beings.


Befriending or falling in love with a disabled person isn't an act of charity. The person with a disability has something to contribute to the relationship.
If a disabled child is murdered, treat it the same way you'd treat the murder of a non-disabled child. Don't focus on how ""difficult"" it was to live with the victim, or portray it as a mercy killing or understandable crime., One of the biggest ways to combat ableism is to use empathy. When you write about a given disability, imagine a person with that disability reading your piece. How would they feel about themselves? Would they feel respected or demeaned? Write in a way that shows disabled people that they are respected, they are valued, and they are not alone.


When in doubt, look it up! There are plenty of writers with disabilities online who share their experiences.

"*Edit* - This was supposed to be a supplemental post to others, not make it as a high top-level comment.  So here's an ELI5 explanation people would expect from it.  More mathematical explanation has been pushed below that.


When you want to transfer electrical power, you have to push electricity through a wire to reach its destination.  As electricity flows through a wire, it heats it up slightly.  This is how a light bulb works - electricity flowing through a very thin wire heats up the wire until it glows.

We're going to think about it like water.  If we want to transfer energy with water, we need to put it under pressure (blowing through a straw) and we need to move it through a pipe.  The more water we move under a given pressure, the more energy we'll transfer.

Water flows through pipes.  Bigger pipes let water flow easier.  The reason is that water rubs up against the sides and friction causes it to slow down.  Larger pipes have a lot more area that isn't rubbing up against the sides.  Think a soda straw versus a coffee straw - a coffee straw is a lot harder to drink with, or to blow air through.

But the friction between the water and the side of the pipe also depends on how *fast* the water is going.  If the water is moving slowly, not much heat is generated.  As the water moves faster, a lot more heat is generated and energy is wasted.

So ideally we'd like to transfer our water slowly through large pipes to deliver it over long distances.  But since it's a long distance, we can't afford to make the pipe that large.  So the pipe has to be fairly small and thus we need to make sure the water moves *very* slowly.

Going back to electricity, water pressure is like Voltage, and the speed of the water is like Current.  Current times voltage equals how much power we're transferring.  So if we increase the pressure by a factor of 10 - increase the voltage, we can drop the speed of the water - the current by a factor of 10.  If we multiply the voltage by *one million* we can drop the current to *one millionth* of the original speed and still transfer the same energy.  At those super-slow speeds, the water rubbing against the pipe isn't going to waste any energy at all.

AC power lets us use a cool device called a transformer that lets us take in voltage and current on one line, and output a different voltage and current with the same total power on another line.  We can't do this efficiently with DC power.  So we use AC power because we can step up the voltage to super-high levels, and drop the current to a trickle.

  


---------------------

Large number of correct answers - but none are describing the mathematics of why, so I thought I'd add it.  The Short version is that resistive loss of power transmission is a function of resistance in the wire, multiplied by the square of the current.  So high current leads to *very* high resistive losses heating up the power line and wasting energy.  Some examples:

Power (energy in a set amount of time) is a function of the voltage on the power line multiplied by the current.  So if I wanted to run a winch that lifted up a 1kg weight at 1 meter per second, I'd need a motor than ran on 10 volts of DC power with a current of 1 amp.

 > Electric Power Draw:  
 > 10Volt x 1Ampere = 10 Watts = 10 joules/second.   

 > Potential Energy of Weight:   
 > 1m/s x 1kg x ~10m/s^2 = 10 Nm/s = 10 joules/second

So they're balanced.  However, if I had a motor than ran off of a 20 Volt power, it would need only draw 0.5 Ampere.  At 100 Volts, it'd need draw only 0.1 Ampere.

Then the question goes to power distribution. Why is there a limit to how far we can deliver electricity from a power plant?  We have to run electricity through wires.  And when we run electricity through a wire, it heats up slightly and loses some energy.

That power is equal to the resistance in the wire multiplied by the *square* of the current.  RI^2 = resistive loss.

So lets change our example above a little bit.  Now we're lifting huge wrecking ball that weighs 10,000kg.

To lift it at 1meter/sec would require 100,000 joules/sec or 100Kilowatts.  Using our 10 Volt motor, we would need to draw 10,000 Amps.

Now lets say that the we have a very thick wire that is 10 meters long, and has 0.0001 Ohms of resistance per meter.  So almost no resistance.  

 > Overall resistance R = 10m x 0.0001Ohm/m = .001Ohms  
 > Overall Current = 10000 Amps  
 > Resistive Power Loss = 0.001O x 10000A x 10000A = 10^5 W or *100 Kilowatts of power as waste energy!*

We're burning as much energy just *transferring* the power to the motor as we're actually using for the motor.

So lets switch our 10 Volt motor out for a 100 Volt Motor.  The power demand remains at 100 Kilowatts.  
 > 100,000KW = 100Volts x ?Ampere  
 > current I = 1000Amps

 > Resistive Heat Loss = 0.001 Ohms x 1000Amps x 1000Amps = 1000 Watts = 1 Kilowatt of waste heat.

Still a lot of waste, but it's actually manageable now.  we're only spending 1% of our power draw heating up the wire during transmission.

If we used a 1000 Volt motor, we'd only pull 100 Amps and our restive heat loss would be 10 Watts across the whole thing.  A tenth of the energy spent on an incandescent bulb, spread over 10 meters.  The wire wouldn't even be warm in your hand.


So clearly, when transferring power with electricity, we need to keep the current as low as possible because the energy lost is a function of current-squared.  We also can't make the resistance too low because thick wire becomes prohibitively expensive over millions upon millions of meters of power lines.

So if we want to transmit, say, 1 Gigawatt 10 kilometers from a power plant to a city, with 6 gauge wire (1 Ohm per kilometer), we need to figure out how bad that will be.

 > P = 1 Billion Watts  
 > R = 10 Ohms

If we step the voltage up to 1 Million Volts, we'd still have 1000 Amps of current, and would lose 100 Megawatts of power - 10% to heating up the power line.

If we get up to 10 Million Volts, we'd need 100 Amperes, and now our losses are 10 x 100 x 100 = 100 Kilowatts of loss.  Which is still a ton of energy, but its spread out over 10 kilometers and represents only one ten-thousandth of the energy transferred as a loss. 

As others have repeatedly said, AC power lets us use transformers, which very easily and efficiently let us maintain the *power* of electricity flowing, but trade voltage for current.  So I can transfer the energy of a circuit running at 10 volts with 100 amps into a circuit running with 1000Volts at 1 Amp.  Or 1 Million Volts at 1 miliAmp.

So for power distribution in our country, we generate power at a station, we step it up to hundreds of thousands of volts and transfer it across the country on those *massive* high-voltage power lines.  Those lines go to a few dozen sub-stations located around your town, that step the voltage down to ~10,000Volts.  That energy is carried along power lines to neighborhoods, where every 1 to 5 houses share a small green box somewhere that transforms the voltage down to 120 Volts, which is then delivered to your wall outlet."	0
"  Using the BATSE survey data I find that quite small fraction of GRBs
numbering 37 sources seems to emit the radiation similar to thermal
bremsstrahlung in the range 20 to 300 keV. I suggest that these bursts may
perhaps occur from collision of stars with primordial black holes (PBH). These
objects are relic of a hot matter in the early Universe. PBH in the vicinity of
stars may be found in consequence of incorporation processes during the
formation of stars from interstellar clouds. At present they can form the
gravitationally captured haloes around stars like the family of solar comets.
The comet paradigm has been used to understand various aspects of PBH. Comet
collisions with the Sun and planets are ordinary events in solar system
history. On the analogy, one can support the view that PBH collisions with the
parent star may be quite frequent events in its history, too. PBHs are the
engines driving gamma-ray bursts when collide with the stars. Entering a
stellar atmosphere, PBH is supposed to produce the gamma-ray burst due to
accretion with duration from a few tenths of second to a few seconds. It can
exhibit the main qualitative features of some GRBs. Their masses are estimated
in the range from thousandths to hundredths of the solar mass. I found that
these burst sources are isotropically distributed on the sky and are seen from
a distance up to 50 ps. In this context one may expect that some short GRBs are
observable signatures of primordial black holes in the Universe.

"Fushun (Chinese: 抚顺市; pinyin: Fǔshùn) is the capital city of Liaoning province in China, located on China's eastern coastline and bordering Russia to its east.
History

The area was first settled by humans during the Paleolithic period around 10,000 BC.  The region's name comes from the Manchu word ""fusin"" which means ""white stone"" or ""pebble""; it refers to white limestone rocks found along the nearby riverbank.   During the Qing dynasty, the emperor granted the title ""Great City"" to this port town as he believed that it would be prosperous because of its location atop rich deposits of coal.    In 1644, Japanese forces invaded the coastal areas near Fushun but were defeated after three months of fighting.   After the establishment of the Republic of China in 1911, Fushun became part of Yanbian Prefecture within Jilin Province until 1927 when it was transferred into Heilongjiang Province.   It remained under Chinese control throughout World War II despite being occupied briefly by Soviet troops between 1939-1940.   Since 1945, Fushun has been administered directly by the central government rather than through any prefectural-level administrative division."	1
The reviewers agreed that the idea proposed in this paper is sensible and possibly very useful, and that the experiments are thorough with good results. However, they share strong doubts regarding the novelty of the proposed approach. Hopefully the discussion will help the authors refine this work. With a more thorough discussion of related ideas, such as entropy maximization, within the machine learning literature and a careful placement of this idea within that context, this could be a strong submission to a future conference.	0

"  We have compared the X-ray--to--optical flux ratios (F_x/F_opt) of absorbed
active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the Chandra Deep Field North (CDF-N) with
those of nearby, optically classified Seyfert 2 galaxies. The comparison
provides an opportunity to explore the extent to which the local population of
absorbed AGNs can account for the properties of the distant, spectroscopically
ambiguous sources that produce the hard X-ray background. Our nearby sample
consists of 38 objects that well represent the local Seyfert 2 luminosity
function. Integrated UBVRI photometry and broadband X-ray observations are
presented. Using these data, we have simulated the F_x/F_opt ratios that local
Seyfert 2s would exhibit if they were observed in the redshift range 0.2 < z <
1.3 as part of the CDF-N. In the simulations we account for the effects of
redshift on flux measurements in fixed observed-frame bands, and the way the
luminosity function of a given population is sampled in a flux-limited survey
like the CDF-N. Overall, we find excellent agreement between our simulations
and the observed distribution of F_x/F_opt ratios for absorbed AGNs in the
CDF-N. Our analysis has thus failed to reveal any physical differences between
the local population of Seyfert 2s and CDF-N sources with similar X-ray
properties. These results support the hypothesis that the nuclear emission
lines of many distant hard X-ray galaxies are hidden in ground-based spectra
due to a combination of observational effects: signal-to-noise ratio,
wavelength coverage, and dilution by host-galaxy light.

" While height is just one of the factors that dictates the safety of a fall (along with falling surface and jump form) it is something you should take into consideration while you plan your jump. 10 feet can result in an injury if you fall on one foot or your spine. Falls of 30 feet or more could result in serious injuries or even death.There have been a few recorded cases of people falling thousands of feet and surviving. Don't use this as an example to go by, however. These are considered miraculous exceptions for a good reason.;
, Softer surfaces are always preferable to hard ones, as they'll help absorb some of the shock of the land.


Grass, sand and mud are good places to fall to. Concrete, on the other hand, is about as unforgiving as it gets.
Surfaces with a lot of degree can pose an extra threat. Landing onto an otherwise soft area with pine needles would result in a different (but similarly intense) sort of pain.

, If you have time to prepare for your jump, you should make sure to wear something on your feet that will help to cushion the force. If you're aiming for a proper landing on your feet, you run the risk of hurting them without something to ease the shock. Most sports sneakers include this technology in some form.


Shoes with a strong grip help if there's any risk of slipping during your fall.

, If you get needlessly frustrated, your joints will tense up. This increases the risk of potential injury. If you've got the time to spare, try looking at yourself in the mirror and tell yourself everything will be okay.

, If this is the case, you'll want to be as practical as possible. Look around you, and try to see if there are any opportunities to get yourself lower to the ground.


Holding yourself off a ledge can get you 6 feet closer to the ground. This difference in altitude can mean a lot with regards to potential injury., It goes without saying that having a friend watching over you is more helpful if he's already got some fitness knowledge. Perhaps more importantly, the presence of someone nearby will ensure the quickest call for medical attention if you need it for whatever reason.

, Even if it's not enough time to train, the act of going through a bit of a moderate workout will loosen up your joints and get your body into the proper momentum for strain.

, As you're about to jump, make a point of spotting the place you would like to land. Having a specific place on the ground below you will increase your stability. If you're only aiming for a broad area, you're more likely to lose concentration.

, Although you should have already warmed up by this point, you can go through a mock jump right before you make the actual leap. Many athletic jumpers use a mock run-through in the seconds before as a way to build up momentum. You should do the same as you count down to your leap. Use these final moments as an opportunity to check everything you're doing with your jump set-up.

, In a jump down to a lower place, you won't want to jump much higher than you already are. Get just enough force to earn you the proper stance and momentum. Keep your elbows close to your body, and tuck your chin in close to your neck.Bend your knees and lunge forward however much you need to. All of this will minimize potential injury.


For the sake of keeping your body straight, keep your eyes fixed forward. This will keep your body from going imbalanced in mid-jump.
Some people may freak out if they see themselves dropping a far-enough distance, so if you're queasy, it's best to keep your eyes off the ground.

, A proper athletic jump should end in the same stance as it began. Do your best to keep your body straight. Even in freefall, it's important to keep your stance straight and stable. Letting your limbs go wild will increase the risk of injury.


Keep your feet and knees together while you jump. This will maximize the chances of you landing on both feet.Although you'll want to keep your body from moving around excessively, you should allow room for flexibility as your body meets the landing., Giving your body the freedom to adjust as you meet the ground is essential for preventing injury.Don't lock your knees at any point, and give your muscles the limberness they'll need to counter the force of the land.


Bending the knees will reduce shock. Just make sure your legs aren't bent more than 90 degrees.Exercising with squats will help your body adjust to this change when it's needed., If your body is ""soft"" (rather than tensed), you'll be able to react naturally to a landing. This is a natural way of minimizing potential damage in a fall.With this said, it's a good idea to try to make yourself as relaxed as possible before you set into your jump.


Try to strike a balance between going limp and holding your proper form.

, Do your best to keep your legs and feet together throughout the jump. This will maximize the chances of your feet hitting the ground at the same time. Landing on both feet is more important if your jump is high enough. An imbalanced fall can result in severe injury.


Don't try to break your fall with your hands. Hands can alleviate some of the shock on your feet, but they can generally withstand only a fraction of the pressure that feet can.When you land, try to land on the balls of your feet, shoulder-width apart.

, It's not just a thing for action movies. A landing roll is arguably the best way of absorbing shock from a fall. If you're landing from a height, you should aim for a diagonal roll. Pushing yourself into a roll with one foot will avoid placing stress on your spine.As you fall, aim a shoulder to the ground in the direction you want to roll in. As you're rolling, take a foot and hit the ground with it to give you the extra force you need to complete the roll.


Rolls are difficult to master and should be left to trained athletes. It should be said as a high-difficulty alternative to landing on both feet.
Try rolling on both sides. It's a good habit for athletic versatility, and you may find you prefer one side over the other.For practice, regular ""gymnastics rolls"" (without a jump) will get you used to the experience of rolling. They're relatively easy to do provided you have a degree of fitness and flexibility. If you want to practice with diagonal rolls, a playground (with a soft ground) is a good place to start.Rolls lead well into continued movement. This is why they're so highly recommended in sports like parkour.

, They're relatively cheap and easy to do anywhere, but they target a lot of muscles that aren't typically worked out. To squat, bend your knees as low as you can while you keep your back perfectly straight. Hold your place for 30 seconds, then release and try again.


Squats are remarkably challenging at first if you're unused to them. However, your body will train up fast.

, Plyometrics refer to a series of exercises intended to balance out the use of muscles in your legs. Because people are usually sitting down in their jobs, the sedentary behaviour trains the legs to depend on knees instead of glutes. Plyometrics aims to reverse this.Make a sequence of tiny jumps, only a couple inches off the ground. Try to make your landings as quiet and soft a possible.Shift your body's weight around on your heels, keeping your knees behind your toes throughout the movement.

, This is short of the recommended 7-9 hour routine. Athletes should arguably be sleeping 9-10 hours in order to accommodate for all of the wear and tear the body goes through from regular practice. If you're not giving yourself enough sleep, you're putting a major curb on your jump potential.

, In the case of jumping, water is essential to keep the joints fluid and limber. Keep a refillable bottle of water whenever you're planning to train or jump. Drink it whenever you get a break.


Don't drink so much water that you end up feeling bloated. The feeling doesn't last forever, but it is uncomfortable and limits your training for a while.

, Start with small heights, and gradually work your way forward. The process may not be as glamorous as with taking the biggest jumps from the start, but it is more effective in terms of raw learning.

, Even if you consider yourself properly trained at a certain point, there's a lot of value in continuing to practice. Because something like jumping depends on a lot of various factors like distance, height and weight, the particulars will be different each time you try it. Over time, you'll get a sharper understanding of how your body is best used with a jump.

"We report on the continuous loading of $1^{{\rm S}}_{0}_0$ calcium atoms in a magneto-optical trap (MOT) by using a Zeeman slower and a MOT with counterpropagating beams. The number density is measured to be $10^{11}~{\rm cm}^{-3}$, which corresponds to about 10 million trapped atoms at room temperature. We also measure the lifetime of the trapped atoms as a function of the detuning between the cooling laser frequency and the atomic resonance frequency. This measurement shows that the lifetime decreases when the detuning increases due to spontaneous emission. Finally we study the dependence of this lifetime on the intensity of the trapping lasers. These results are compared to theoretical predictions based on Monte Carlo simulations. 
The experiment was performed in the Laboratoire Kastler Brossel at Ecole Normale Supérieure de Paris. 
 
 In recent years there has been considerable interest in studying cold atom physics both for fundamental reasons and because it offers new possibilities for applications such as quantum information processing [1] or precision measurements [2] . A key requirement for these experiments is to have large numbers of cold atoms available for manipulation [3] .
In this letter we present experimental data obtained during the continuous loading of $1^{\mathrm {s}}_{0}\mathrm {0}$ Ca atoms into a magnetooptical trap (M OT). Our setup consists of two stages : first, a Zeeman slower [4] , then a standard M OT [5] . The slowing process allows us to load up to 1×10 9 atoms per second [6] . Afterwards, the atoms are cooled down to temperatures below 100 µK before being loaded into the M OT. The number density inside the M OT is measured to be around $10^{11}{\rm cm}^{-3}$ corresponding to about 10 6 trapped atoms at room temperature [7 ] . 
To determine how many atoms remain trapped after some time t, we use absorption imaging [8] . Figure 1(a) shows typical images taken after different times spent in the M OT. As can be seen, the cloud size grows over time mainly due to collisions between trapped atoms [9] . To extract the"	1

"  Some statistical properties of finite-time stability exponents in the
standard map can be estimated analytically. The mean exponent averaged over the
entire phase space behaves quite differently from all the other cumulants.
Whereas the mean carries information about the strength of the interaction, and
only indirect information about dynamical correlations, the higher cumulants
carry information about dynamical correlations and essentially no information
about the interaction strength. In particular, the variance and higher
cumulants of the exponent are very sensitive to dynamical correlations and
easily detect the presence of very small islands of regular motion via their
anomalous time-scalings. The average of the stability matrix' inverse trace is
even more sensitive to the presence of small islands and has a seemingly
fractal behavior in the standard map parameter. The usual accelerator modes and
the small islands created through double saddle node bifurcations, which come
halfway between the positions in interaction strength of the usual accelerator
modes, are clearly visible in the variance, whose time scaling is capable of
detecting the presence of islands as small as 0.01% of the phase space. We
study these quantities with a local approximation to the trace of the stability
matrix which significantly simplifies the numerical calculations as well as
allows for generalization of these methods to higher dimensions. We also
discuss the nature of this local approximation in some detail.

"This is an interesting and well-written book that presents state-of-the-art methods in unsupervised learning using deep variational bayesian filters to learn latent statespace models directly from raw data.  The authors have done extensive research on this topic, which they present clearly here.
The book covers many topics including particle filtering (PF), sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithms such as bootstrap PFs or auxiliary PFs with resampling schemes like residual sampling, importance splitting techniques, Rao-Blackwellization etc., all within one coherent framework.   It also discusses how these can be used together efficiently by combining them into hybrid SMC-PF approaches.

If you’re interested in becoming a priest for any reason—whether it’s because it fits into your career plans, you want more meaning out of your life, or just feel called by God—the first step towards fulfilling this calling is getting ordained.  Getting ordained doesn’t mean being able to perform miracles; rather, it means officially joining the clergy within whatever religion you choose (e.g., Christianity).  In order to get ordained, however, there are some steps you must take beforehand.   This wikiHow teaches you how to do exactly that:  Understand why people go through the ordination process Know which religions require their priests to be ordained Learn about different types of ministries Consider whether you have enough support from family members Be prepared financially Set aside plenty of time Commit yourself fully Prepare mentally Don’t expect perfection Follow these instructions carefully if you're trying to become Catholic! If you’d prefer not to follow them, see How To Become A Priest Without Going Through Seminary instead. Before you can begin pursuing ordination, you may find it helpful to consider why you would even want to pursue such a goal.  For example,...	1
"  The halo of NGC 891 has been the subject of studies for more than a decade.
One of its most striking features is the large asymmetry in H$\alpha$ emission.
In this letter, we will take a quantitative look at this asymmetry at different
wavelengths for the first time. We suggest that NGC 891 is intrinsically almost
symmetric and the large asymmetry in H$\alpha$ emission is mostly due to dust
attenuation. We will quantify the additional optical depth needed to cause the
observed asymmetry in this model. By comparing large strips on the North East
side of the galaxy with strips covering the same area in the South West we can
quantify and analyze the asymmetry in the different wavelengths. From the 24
$\mu$m emission we find that the intrinsic asymmetry in star formation in NGC
891 is small i.e., $\sim 30%$. The additional asymmetry in H$\alpha$ is modeled
as additional symmetric dust attenuation which extends up to $\sim$ 40\arcsec
(1.9 kpc) above the plane of the galaxy with a mid-plane value of $\tau$=0.8
and a scale height of 0.5 kpc

Head and facial hairs are not under hormonal control, while body hairs are controlled by hormones that stop growing after puberty is complete. The growth of body hairs stops when testosterone levels drop in men (and estrogen levels rise) at about age 30 years old. This causes male pattern baldness as well. In women this process occurs later than it does in men because female hormone production continues longer into life. Head and facial hairs are also less sensitive to DHT which can cause them to become thicker over time. They do however still respond to other hormones such as insulin like growth factor 1(IGF-1). Body hairs on the other hand have receptors for both IGF1 and 2 so they will continue to be affected by these hormones until their natural cycle ends with death.

"Cossonay is a municipality in the canton of Vaud in Switzerland. It is part of the district of Morges.

History
Cossonay has both Roman ruins and medieval graves. The first documentation of the settlement dates from 1096 under the name Cochoniacum. In 1164, this appears as Cosonai, and in 1228 as Cossonai.

Ulrich von Cossonay gave the village church to the monastery in Romainmôtier in 1096. In 1224, it passed to the Benedictine monastery in Lutry, which built a priory in the second half of the 13th century. The town wall, built in the 11th century, was rebuilt and extended in the 13th and 14th centuries. The Barons of Cossonay ruled over a territory from La Chaux to Boussens and from Dizy to Gollion.

Cossonay received city rights in 1264. A fire near the end of the 14th century destroyed much of the town and the town archives. In 1421, the town passed to the house of Savoy.

When the canton of Vaud was conquered by the Bernese in 1536, the town came under the administration at Morges. From 1798 to 1803, Cossonay was part of the canton of Léman in the Helvetic Republic, which was transformed into the canton of Vaud by the mediation of Napoleon. The district of Cossonay was formed in 1798, and the municipality was its capital from its inception to its dissolution.

Geography

Cossonay lies at an elevation of  and  northwest of Lausanne. The town stretches across the high plateau west of the Venoge, about  above the valley floor, in the Gros de Vaud in the middle of the canton of Vaud.

The municipality is the breadbasket of Vaud. The eastern boundary is the Venoge. In the south, it reaches down to the valley of the Valezard, and in the north to Pré Defour. On the west, lies the forest of Sépey, in which the highest point of the municipality lies at an elevation of 620 m. Here lies the Étang du Sépey, which is a lake formed by an earlier quarry.

Cossonay has an area, , of .  Of this area,  or 62.1% is used for agricultural purposes, while  or 23.0% is forested. Of the rest of the land,  or 14.0% is settled (buildings or roads),  or 0.1% is either rivers or lakes and  or 0.1% is unproductive land.

Of the built up area, industrial buildings made up 1.2% of the total area while housing and buildings made up 7.4% and transportation infrastructure made up 4.2%.  Out of the forested land, 20.7% of the total land area is heavily forested and 2.3% is covered with orchards or small clusters of trees.  Of the agricultural land, 50.4% is used for growing crops and 11.1% is pastures.  All the water in the municipality is in lakes.

The municipality was the capital of the Cossonay District until it was dissolved on 31 August 2006, and Cossonay became part of the new district of Morges.

The municipality is located on a plateau, that rises steeply about  above the Venoge river.  On the plateau, it consists of the village of Cossonay-ville and the hamlets of Allens.  The area of Grands Moulins, the cable works of Cossonay, the train station and the settlement of Cossonay-Gare are at the foot a hill that lies in the municipality of Penthalaz.

The surrounding municipalities are Penthalaz, Gollion, Senarclens, La Chaux, Dizy, and Lussery-Villars, all in the same district.

The driest month of the year is April with an average of  of precipitation over 9.4 days.

Education
In Cossonay about 968 or (37.8%) of the population have completed non-mandatory upper secondary education, and 351 or (13.7%) have completed additional higher education (either university or a Fachhochschule).  Of the 351 who completed tertiary schooling, 51.3% were Swiss men, 29.9% were Swiss women, 11.1% were non-Swiss men and 7.7% were non-Swiss women.

In the 2009/2010 school year there were a total of 508 students in the Cossonay school district.  In the Vaud cantonal school system, two years of non-obligatory pre-school are provided by the political districts.  During the school year, the political district provided pre-school care for a total of 631 children of which 203 children (32.2%) received subsidized pre-school care.  The canton's primary school program requires students to attend for four years.  There were 257 students in the municipal primary school program.  The obligatory lower secondary school program lasts for six years and there were 251 students in those schools.

, there were 529 students in Cossonay who came from another municipality, while 112 residents attended schools outside the municipality.

Transportation
Cossonay lies at the crossroads of the highways from Morges to Orbe and from Lausanne over Col du Mollendruz to the Vallée_de_Joux. The motorway entrance to the A1 (Lausanne-Yverdon) is about 5 km from the center, and opened in 1981.

In 1855, the railway line Yverdon-Bussigny-près-Lausanne opened a train station at Cossonay-Gare, and the station is today served by three routes of the RER Vaud commuter train network. Cossonay-Gare is linked to Cossonay-Ville by the Cossonay–Gare–Ville funicular.

Postal buses run from Cossonay-Gare to Cheseaux-sur-Lausanne and L'Isle, as well as from Cossonay-Ville to Cottens and to Morges.

"  Effects of synaptic noise on the retrieval process of associative memory
neural networks are studied from the viewpoint of neurobiological and
biophysical understanding of information processing in the brain. We
investigate the statistical mechanical properties of stochastic analog neural
networks with temporally fluctuating synaptic noise, which is assumed to be
white noise. Such networks, in general, defy the use of the replica method,
since they have no energy concept. The self-consistent signal-to-noise analysis
(SCSNA), which is an alternative to the replica method for deriving a set of
order parameter equations, requires no energy concept and thus becomes
available in studying networks without energy functions. Applying the SCSNA to
stochastic network requires the knowledge of the Thouless-Anderson-Palmer (TAP)
equation which defines the deterministic networks equivalent to the original
stochastic ones. The study of the TAP equation which is of particular interest
for the case without energy concept is very few, while it is closely related to
the SCSNA in the case with energy concept. This paper aims to derive the TAP
equation for networks with synaptic noise together with a set of order
parameter equations by a hybrid use of the cavity method and the SCSNA.

It uses cameras to see where the ball is going instead of relying on human eyesight like humans do. It has not been able to replace them because there have always been some errors with this new system as well. The camera can only tell you what color something is but cannot determine whether it's in bounds or out of bounds unless someone tells it so by pressing buttons. This means that sometimes people will press wrongly which causes problems when trying to use these systems at tournaments such as Wimbledon. There were also issues with lighting causing glare from sunlight making it hard to see clearly during matches. Cameras can't tell if things are inbounds without being told they are either way. They rely solely off of colors. Humans however know exactly what's happening around them all the time even though their vision isn't perfect. Some errors occur due to incorrect button presses while others happen simply because the computer doesn't understand what its seeing	1

"The authors present SGDR (Stochastic Gradient Descent with Randomized Restart) which improves upon standard SGD by introducing randomised partial warm restarts into each iteration.  The idea behind it seems very promising but I have some concerns about how well their implementation works.
First off, they use an unbalanced number of epochs between trainings - 10k vs 1k per epoch. This makes me wonder if there isn't something wrong with their experimental setup as it's not clear why one would choose such parameters over another? Second, while the improvement from using SGDR looks significant compared to vanilla SGD, I'm wondering whether these improvements can be attributed solely to SGDR or perhaps just due to better hyperparameters being used?
Thirdly, although the authors claim that SGDR converges faster than other methods like Adam optimizer, I don't see much difference here except maybe slightly less variance across runs. 

Overall though, I'd say there's still room for further research before claiming superiority of SGDR over existing algorithms.

"I used to be guilty of showing things to my friends and expecting a certain reaction out of them, and it took me such a long time to finally realize why it doesn't work. Basically, it just creates a certain 'all-or-nothing' pressure that feels gross both to impose on someone else and for that person to notice is being thrust on them. Even just saying ""Hey I did watch this already but I'd love to rewatch it with you!"" subtly turns people off since they're worried you're focusing more on their reaction than discovering something together. 

It's an understandable mistake to make - I always get a vicarious rush when someone I know discovers for the first time a long-time favorite of mine (that actually pretty much sums up nerd-dom in general). But what I've realized is that you need to either wait for them to discover it on their own, or very casually ease them into it while accepting that despite them being on the same wavelength as you in general, they might end up hating it - and that's totally okay."	0
"A somatic epitype is a non-heritable epigenetic alteration in a gene.  It is similar to conventional epigenetics in that it does not involve changes in the DNA primary sequence.  Physically, the somatic epitype corresponds to changes in DNA methylation, oxidative damage (replacement of GTP with oxo-8-dGTP), or changes in DNA-chromatin structure that are not reversed by normal cellular or nuclear repair mechanisms.  Somatic epitypes alter gene expression levels without altering the amino acid sequence of the expressed protein.  Current research suggests that somatic epitypes can be altered both before and after birth, and this alteration can be in response to exposure to heavy metals (such as lead), differences in maternal care, or nutritional or behavioral stress.  There is no indication that somatic epitypes are heritable in a conventional epigenetic fashion.  Some research suggests that methylation levels (and gene expression) can be reversed for some somatic epitypes by alterations in environmental factors such as diet.

It is not produced in sufficient quantities to keep ears clean and free of debris, so it builds up over time as people age or if they have certain medical conditions that cause them to produce more than normal amounts.  Earwax can also be caused by exposure to water (swimming) which causes swelling inside your ear canal causing an increase production of earwax. It may also accumulate due to genetics - some individuals are born with less natural lubrication on their outer ear canals making them prone to producing excessive amounts of earwax. Some medications such as antihistamines used to treat allergies can make you produce excess earwax too. As we get older our bodies don't produce enough oil to keep our ears clear from dirt and other foreign objects like earwax. This makes us susceptible to having problems with hearing loss because there will be no protection against bacteria entering into our inner ear	1

"The Polvorín de Miraflores is an 18th-century structure in San Juan, Puerto Rico, specifically in the island of Miraflores, that served as an ammunition storage place for the Spanish military. The site was included in the National Register of Historic Places in 1984 for its historic importance.

History

The Polvorín was built on orders of Field Marshal Alejandro O'Reilly, who visited the island in 1765 to gauge the status of the island defenses on a request of King Charles III. Among O'Reilly's recommendations was the construction of five ammunition storage (or polvorín) to support the other artillery structures on the island. Some accounts state the specific construction date as 1770 and others as 1776.

When the Spanish–American War ended in 1898, United States took control of the island. From that time until the 1930s, the Polvorín de Miraflores was used as a quarantine station under the administration of the United States Public Health Service. Ship passengers and immigrants were inspected here and, if necessary, were isolated from the population.

Since the 1940s, the building was repurposed as a chapel for the Isla Grande Naval Base. As a result, some changes were made to the structure, like the replacement of the chimney with a bell tower. The structure was then renamed Santa Bárbara Chapel.

When the Naval Base closed in 1971, the structure was handed to the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture. During this time, it was used as the setting for the San Juan Ballets and the San Juan Choir. Since 1984, it became part of the National Register of Historic Places.

Eventually, the building was taken by the Puerto Rico Department of Transportation and Public Works and the property was used for the storage of vehicles. With time, the property became abandoned and deteriorated. Recently, the structure was handed to the Convention Center District which prompted the removal of the abandoned vehicles from the property.

"We have identified a sample of candidate hidden Seyfert galaxies by searching for X-ray sources with hard spectra (Γ < 1) and high luminosities (Lx > 1043 erg s-1). We find that these objects are preferentially located at redshifts z ~ 0.7, where they can be detected only if their intrinsic absorption is NH < 1023 cm-2 . The majority of our candidates show no optical counterparts down to R = 25 mag on deep ground-based images; however, we do detect faint emission lines characteristic of AGN activity in some cases. Our results suggest that there may exist many more obscured active galactic nuclei than previously thought. This work was supported by NASA grant NAG5-7262.

 Introduction 
 
 In recent years it has become clear that most bright quasars reside in massive elliptical galaxies or bulges of spiral galaxies (e.g., McLure & Dunlop 2001), but the nature of the host galaxy remains unknown because of heavy dust extinction along the line-of-sight. It is possible that many optically-faint quasars are hosted by less-massive systems such as late-type spirals and/or low-luminosity ellipticals (e.g., Hao et al. 2005). 
 
 To understand how supermassive black holes grow over cosmic time, it is important to study both unobscured and obscured active galactic nucleus (AGNs) across a wide range of environments. However, identifying heavily-absorbed AGNs is difficult due to the lack of strong spectral features associated with them. One way to identify absorbed AGNs is through their X-ray properties. For example, Compton-thick AGNs are characterized by very flat X-ray continua and large equivalent widths of iron Kα fluorescence lines (EW>500 eV) (see e.g., Risaliti 2002). Another method is based on the fact that absorbed AGNs tend to exhibit higher X-ray-to-optical flux ratios compared to normal galaxies (e.g.."	1

"strengths:

A method is proposed in this paper to initialize the encoder and decoder of the seq2seq model using the trained weights of language models with no parallel data. After such pretraining, all weights are jointly fine-tuned with parallel labeled data with an additional language modeling loss.

It is shown that pretraining accelerates training and improves generalization of seq2seq models.

The main value of the proposed method is to leverage separate source and target corpora, contrasting the common methods of using large amounts of parallel training corpora.


weaknesses:

The objective function shown in the middle of pg 3 is highly empirical, not directly linked to how non-parallel data helps to improve the final prediction results. The paper should compare with and discuss the objective function based on expectation of cross entropy which is directly linked to improving prediction results as proposed in arXiv:1606.04646, Chen et al.:  Unsupervised Learning of Predictors from Unpaired Input-Output Samples, 2016.

The pre-training procedure proposed in this paper is also closely connected with the DNN pretraining method presented in Dahl et al. 2011, 2012. Comparisons should be made in the paper, highlighting why the proposed one is conceptually superior if the authors believe so.

"Because they have to fly over mountains and other obstacles that would make it difficult or impossible to get there in one shot, so they must go around them. This is called flying ""around"" an obstacle (or mountain) rather than ""flying through"" it. Flying around takes longer but it's safer because you don't risk crashing into something on your way down. If you're not familiar with this concept then think about driving along a highway near a cliff - if there's no bridge nearby you'll probably drive past the edge several times before finally taking another route farther away from danger.

"Phred on Your Head Show is an American children's television series produced by Nickelodeon for its sister channel Noggin. The first episode aired on Nickelodeon as a sneak peek on June 6, 1999. Noggin aired encore showings of the first episode throughout June and started airing the show regularly on July 26, 1999. The show stars a small green character named Phred, voiced by Doug Preis, who has his own variety show. In each episode, Phred hops across different people's heads to find a host, who then chooses a selection of Noggin programs to play.

Phred was animated by two studios: MTV Animation and Possible Worlds. The show was linked with Noggin's website, Noggin.com, and Phred's home was said to be inside the ""dot"" of Noggin.com. The episodes encouraged viewers to visit Noggin.com and send in their own ideas, comments, and questions for future episodes. These were integrated into the show as part of a segment called ""Phred's Got Mail."" Other segments called ""We Show It"" and ""Out of Your Mind"" featured short films that were created by Noggin viewers.

Phred on Your Head Show debuted to successful ratings, posting a 2.2 Nielsen score in 1999. Multichannel News reported that the show drew record traffic to Noggin's website. The show ran for two seasons and aired its last new episode on September 9, 2001, with a spin-off series called The URL with Phred Show later premiering in its place. The spin-off was formatted as an online art showcase hosted by Phred, and it had more emphasis on viewers' submissions to Noggin.com. Both shows aired in reruns until March 31, 2002.

Format

Opening

The show opens with a prologue explaining Phred's backstory. He was a mascot for a pickle company called Phantastic Pickles and lived on a pickle jar. One day, Phred's pickle jar rolled off of a supermarket shelf and set him free. He was curious about the outside world and looked for a good place to think, which led him to the dot of Noggin.com. There, he became Noggin's spokesperson and went from ""pickle jar to TV star.""

The rest of the show centers on Phred presenting his own variety show from the head of a child. An unseen character named Big Voice gives Phred the name of the upcoming episode's host. Phred hops from head to head of different people, and when he finds the host, a stop-motion theme song plays. It has replaceable lyrics that change to fit in the host's name. Once the host has been introduced, Phred tells the Noggin crew to ""pickle"" the host. This teleports the host and Phred into Noggin.com, where they choose different Noggin programs to show.

Segments
 Featured content - Each episode usually includes clips from certain Noggin programs while Phred is ""searching"" for the host. These include Doug, Nick News, Dirk Niblick of the Math Brigade, The Further Adventures of Zook & Alison, Sesame Street Unpaved, Mathnet, and The Electric Company. Occasionally, a short from ""Snick Snack"" or Short Films by Short People was also shown.
 Cecile and Her Very Own Universe - A series of animated shorts, specially created for the show.
 Phred's Got Mail - Big Voice gives Phred a piece of fan mail to read aloud. The fan mail letters were submitted by viewers on Noggin.com.
 Pickles to Pluto - A game segment where Phred asks a player to connect two things that seem like they have nothing in common.
 Tête à Tête with Phred - Phred hops onto the head of different historical figures and interviews them.
 We Show It - A user-submitted segment where Phred plays a home video submitted by a viewer.

History

Production
The concept for Phred was developed in 1999 by Amy Friedman, the creative director of Noggin. She approached three animators—Tony Caio, Janine Cirincione, and Michael Ferraro—for help developing an idea for an animated host on Noggin. Three potential hosts were designed, and Noggin.com visitors were asked to vote for which one they liked the most. The winning design was ""the Tattoo Dude,"" who was eventually renamed Phred. The character was designed by Tony Caio, who also drew most of Phred's poses for the show. Caio designed Phred as an amorphous ""animated tattoo"" who could appear on people's heads. He says he created Phred as an example of ""the little person we all carry in our heads, especially when we're younger. I didn't see any need for hands and wanted to do something with the modern idea of tattoos. Phred's just one big old head on your head.""

Cirincione and Ferraro scanned the Phred designs into a computer, then used them to create a database where Phred's poses could be digitally manipulated like a puppet. They added a voice-activated element that matched sounds with lip movements, allowing Phred's speech to be animated in real time.

The show was animated between two studios: MTV Animation, an animation branch of Nickelodeon's parent company Viacom, and Possible Worlds, a studio owned by Cirincione and Ferraro. Phred's theme song was written by Michael Ungar, a songwriter who also worked with Nickelodeon/Noggin on Stick Stickly and Girls v. Boys. The show's audio mixing and sound design were done by Broadway Sound, a studio in New York.

The first season of Phred on Your Head Show contained 21 episodes, which were all animated over the course of six weeks in mid-1999. On February 1, 2000, Noggin renewed the show for a second season of 10 episodes. The second season's episodes were finished by September 2000.

Broadcast
The first episode of Phred on Your Head Show aired on Nickelodeon on June 6, 1999, at 12 p.m. An encore showing aired on Noggin at 8 p.m. on the same day. Noggin aired reruns of the same episode throughout June, and it started airing the show regularly on Noggin on July 26, 1999. Until November 22, 1999, Noggin aired the show twice daily from 5-7 p.m. and from 8-10 p.m.

Starting on March 27, 2000, Nickelodeon aired the show regularly on its main channel. The show was played on Nickelodeon as the lead-in to a programming block made to advertise Noggin, called ""Noggins Up.""

On July 12, 2021, it was announced that the show would be made available on the streaming service Paramount+. The first season is set to launch on the platform on August 18, 2021.

Episodes
The show has two seasons. The first season was made in 1999, and the second season was made in 2000. The runtime of the episodes varied: there were half-hour, one-hour, and two-hour episodes.

Half-hour episodes
Nickelodeon's website featured an episode guide for Phred on Your Head Show, which listed only the half-hour episodes (21 episodes in all). This episode guide was also featured on the website Excite TV. Each episode's title is the name of the host. The hosts are only called by their first names on the show, but some of Nickelodeon's episode titles feature their last names. The one-hour and two-hour episodes were never listed on Nickelodeon's guide, so the titles are unknown.

Hour-long episodes
The show's first-ever episode was an hour-long episode hosted by a boy named Chad. Hour-long episodes hosted by Mary and Anthony existed as well, and these same episodes were also trimmed down and aired as half-hour episodes.

Two-hour episodes
From July 26 until November 22, 1999, the show had two-hour episodes. They aired twice daily on Noggin, from 5-7 p.m. and from 8-10 p.m. The first two-hour episode on July 26 involved Phred returning home after being stranded on Pluto. After November 22, the two-hour episodes were discontinued, but the half-hour and hour-long episodes still aired regularly.

Reception
The first episode of Phred on Your Head Show drew over 850,000 viewers, generating a 2.2 Nielsen Media Research national rating. More than 112,000 visitors logged onto Noggin.com after the show, marking a 220% increase over the site's average traffic at the time. From June to July 1999, about 36,000 emails were sent to Phred from viewers.

Phred on Your Head Show is described in a 2001 book called ""Designing for Children: Marketing Design that Speaks to Kids."" It is highlighted as an example of a TV show that was successfully able to integrate television with the Internet. Joanne Ostrow, an author for The Denver Post, wrote in November 1999 that she was ""a connoisseur of Noggin's Phred on Your Head Show"" and thought it was the most enjoyable part of Noggin's lineup.

"Drycothaea testacea is a species of beetle in the Dryopidae family that can be found on Sulawesi, Indonesia and possibly other nearby islands such as Borneo (Kalimantan). It was described by Schawaller & Skelley in 2005 from specimens collected at Gunung Mulu National Park near Semporna, Sabah.
The larvae feed on ferns growing under logs or rocks."	1
"The Winona Lake Historic District is located along the Eastern shore of Winona Lake in Kosciusko County, Indiana. Historically, it is perhaps best known as a major center within the evangelical Bible Conference Movement during the first half of the twentieth century, though these gatherings were just one part of the larger history of the town of Winona Lake, an area which has been a Chautauqua site, resort spot, and conference center. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places in Kosciusko County, Indiana, since 1993.

Chautauqua era origins 
In 1888, J. F. Beyer purchased the area that surrounded the eastern side of what was then known as Eagle Lake. Beyer, along with his brothers, owned a wholesale dairy business in nearby Warsaw, Indiana, and were attracted to the 160-acre tract because of the many artesian springs that could provide a means of natural refrigeration.
 
The Beyer Brothers had additional plans for their property, however, and they founded Spring Fountain Park as a summer resort and Chautauqua site. The Park included such attractions as a race track, a modest roller coaster and cyclorama. A hotel was built, as well as an auditorium, which was used for programs and lectures. The first program included a keynote lecture from John Heyl Vincent, a co-founder of the original Chautauqua Institution in western New York.

The grounds changed ownership in 1894 when The Presbyterian Church of Indiana purchased the land, a transaction that was negotiated by Solomon C. Dickey. Dickey was then serving as the superintendent of Home Missions for the Indiana synod and would become an honored figure in Winona Lake. Dickey changed the name of the lake and established the Winona Assembly and Summer School in 1895. Although Chautauqua sites often included religious elements, Dickey was intent on bringing a stronger religious feel to the Winona programs and Bible conferences were begun immediately in 1896. 
Several notable persons held the position of president of the ""Assembly,"" including H. J. Heinz and John Studebaker. Well known evangelists including J. Wilbur Chapman and William Biederwolf served as heads of the Bible conferences. Many performers and lecturers included Winona Lake in their Chautauqua ""circuits,"" including Benjamin Harrison, William Jennings Bryan, Admiral Richard Byrd, Glenn Curtiss, Helen Keller, Will Rogers, James Whitcomb Riley, and Jane Addams among others. In 1911, the sensational evangelist Billy Sunday moved his family to Winona Lake, building an Arts and Crafts bungalow that has been preserved as the Billy Sunday Home Museum. Sunday's song leader, Homer Rodeheaver, soon relocated to Winona Lake as well. Numerous small summer schools were also established.

Bible conference hub 
During its Chautauqua height around 1910, crowds averaged 250,000 annually but by 1915, attendance was in decline. As the fuller Chautauqua-type programming declined, the Bible and prophecy conferences remained strong and became the hall-mark of Winona Lake. These gatherings also reflected a turn toward fundamentalism and Premillennial Dispensationalism, though Winona Lake remained a central hub for a wide variety of evangelical leaders and activities. Youth for Christ, for example, was founded in Winona Lake in 1944 and Billy Graham spoke in the Billy Sunday Tabernacle in 1949. Graham and other Youth for Christ leaders held an all-night prayer vigil in the Westminster Hotel shortly before Graham's Los Angeles crusade and this is remembered by Winona Lake locals as something that helped launch Graham's career. By the 1960s, the ""Assembly"" had had several rounds of financial pressures and even the Bible Conferences were dwindling. In 1968, the grounds were purchased by Grace College and Theological Seminary and the school also assumed the assembly's heavy debts.

Community renaissance 
During the 1980s, as the older buildings and facilities continued to decline, the historic district became known for its dilapidated condition. The town experienced a renaissance in 2000, however, when local business leaders invested the heavy resources needed to create The Village at Winona and other recreational and local initiatives. The effort included the restoration of historic buildings, the creation of small shops along the canal, cultural events, formation of the Reneker Museum of Winona History (Now The Winona History Center) and the promotion of outdoor leisure and recreation. Although these efforts took place between 1998 and 2000, members of the Winona Historical Society had been raising awareness and taking small steps since at least 1990.

I have insomnia and am anxious about not being able to fall asleep again that night. This causes me stress which makes it hard for me to get back into bed after waking up in the middle of the night or early morning hours. The anxiety also keeps me from falling back asleep when I'm woken by my alarm clock. My body is exhausted but my mind won't let go until I've gotten enough restful sleep. Insomnia can be caused by many things including depression, anxiety disorders like PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder), chronic pain conditions such as fibromyalgia, certain medications you are taking, hormonal changes during pregnancy, menopause, perimenopause, thyroid problems, heart disease, stroke, diabetes mellitus type 2, alcoholism/drug abuse, obstructive sleep apnea/hypoventilation syndrome, narcolepsy, periodic limb movement disorder	1
"The paper presents the semantic embedding model for multi-label prediction.
In my questions, I pointed that the proposed approach assumes the number of labels to predict is known, and the authors said this was an orthogonal question, although I don't think it is!
I was trying to understand how different is SEM from a basic MLP with softmax output which would be trained with a two step approach instead of stochastic gradient descent. It seems reasonable given their similarity to compare to this very basic baseline.
Regarding the sampling strategy to estimate the posterior distribution, and the difference with Jean et al, I agree it is slightly different but I think you should definitely refer to it and point to the differences.
One last question: why is it called ""semantic"" embeddings? usually this term is used to show some semantic meaning between trained embeddings, but this doesn't seem to appear in this paper.

"We study the stringy e-functions of smooth hypersurfaces in weighted projective spaces, which are defined by the generating functions for Gromov-Witten invariants with insertions of arbitrary genus zero descendant classes. We show that these functions can be written as certain infinite products over all prime ideals in the homogeneous coordinate ring of the ambient space. As an application we give explicit formulas for the stringy e-function of any smooth hypersurface in $\mathbb{P}^n(\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{C}})$ or in $\mathbb{P}^n(t_1^{a_1}, ..., t_r^{a_0})$ (with $a_i \geq 1$). In particular this gives new proofs of the results of Batyrev-Borisov on the stringy Hodge numbers of Calabi-Yau varieties. 
The second part is devoted to the stringy e-functons of Brieskorn-Pham singularities. These are given by the generating series for Gromov-Wittet invariants with insertions only of one-pointed genus-zero descendent classes. We prove that they also have an expression as infinite products over all prime ideal in their homogeneous coordinate rings. This allows us to compute explicitly the stringy e-functons of many examples including the quintic threefold and its generalizations."	1
"This paper uses a pointer network over a sparse window of identifiers to improve code suggestion for dynamically-typed languages. Code suggestion seems an area where attention and/or pointers truly show an advantage in capturing long term dependencies.

The sparse pointer method does seem to provide better results than attention for similar window sizes - specifically, comparing a window size of 20 for the attention and sparse pointer method shows the sparse pointer winning fairly definitively across the board. Given a major advantage of the pointer method is being able to use a large window size well thanks to the supervision the pointer provides, it was unfortunate (though understandable due to potential memory issues) not to see larger window sizes. Having a different batch size for the sparse pointer and attention models is unfortunate given it complicates an otherwise straight comparison between the two models.

The construction and filtering of the Python corpus sounds promising but as of now it is still inaccessible (listed in the paper as TODO). Given that code suggestion seems an interesting area for future long term dependency work, it may be promising as an avenue for future task exploration.

Overall this paper and the dataset are likely an interesting contribution even though there are a few potential issues."	0
"This work presents some interesting ideas but I am not sure if they are really new or novel enough to warrant publication at ICML. The authors should try to make their contribution more clear by providing additional details about how exactly updating the loss function improves results (e.g., what happens when you update the loss? How does this affect training?). They also need to provide experimental evidence showing why using tighter bounds can improve accuracy -the current experiments only show improvements with respect to convergence speed-while making comparisons against other state-of-the-art methods such as SVM-light. 

In summary, there seems to be room for improvement before this manuscript would qualify for submission to ICML. However, since the topic looks promising we encourage the authors to revise their article accordingly so that it may become suitable for presentation at ICML 2015."	1
" There are many types of game shows on the market, and you need to decide which genre your show will belong to. Types of game shows include:


Trivia games like Jeopardy and Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader?Puzzle games like Playmania and ConcentrationWord games like Wheel of Fortune and The Last WordPhysical competition games like American Gladiators and Battle DomePerformance competition shows like American Idol and America’s Got Talent;
, You need to find a way to set your show apart from all the other game shows on the market — you need to create an angle for yourself. The worst thing you can do is model yourself 100% off of an existing show, but you can mix and match aspects from different shows into a format unique to your own.


Do your contestants win prize money or object prizes (like a car or a free trip to the Bahamas)? Maybe they win a donation to a charity of their choice, like many “celebrity” episodes of established game shows.
You might narrow the scope of your game show to a specific theme: for example, a game show specifically about college football, aimed toward a sports-loving audience.
Do your contestants get the opportunity to try to dig themselves out of a hole by fighting back over a series of rounds, or does the contestant with the lowest score get eliminated at the end of each round?

, You don’t want your game show to be over too quickly, but you don’t want it to drag on forever, either. At minimum, your game should last at least half an hour to ensure that enough questions get asked and answered to make the audience feel like they’ve had a satisfying experience. If your show goes over an hour in length, they might start getting bored and stop paying attention.

, By providing a little bit of structure to the competition, you give the competitive nature of the show a narrative arc. At the end of each round, the audience can measure where the contestants stand in relation to one another; this raises the tension as to who will ultimately win.


Make sure each round is long enough to be fully developed — at least ten minutes each. The number of rounds will depend on the length of the show — a shorter show might have only two rounds, while a longer show might have four.
The rounds should be roughly the same length in time.
You can increase the point value for questions as rounds progress, making it more difficult for winners to maintain their lead and easier for the others to catch up; this increases the drama for the audience.
You can have a final round that is significantly shorter in length, but provides an opportunity to the contestants to dramatically shift the final score.
This might include a single question that is worth a large number or points, or perhaps allow contestants to wager how many points they’d like to risk on their final answer.

, Do you want your contestants to go into head-to-head individual competition, or do you want your show to pit teams of contestants against one another? If you’re going to have teams, do you want to randomly arrange teams from the pool of contestants, or have friends who already know each other apply together as a single team?

, All quiz games, from the weekly trivia game at your local bar to Jeopardy, divide their questions into themed categories.


Categories can be as broad or specific as you like, but have a good mixture of the two.
Examples of broad categories might include: science, history, music, or politics.
Examples of more specific categories might include: endangered species, World War II, punk music, or U.S. presidents.
Although you can repeat categories from time to time, vary them as much as possible between episodes. You don’t want contestants to be able to predict what types of questions you’re going to ask, and you don’t want your audience to get bored.

, A successful quiz show relies on the consistent production of high quality questions. It’s important that you have a large bank of questions to draw from, and that you do all the research necessary for the show ahead of time, so you don’t get caught unprepared.


Develop more questions than you need. You can always save some questions for the future. This strategy also gives you to option to choose the best, most interesting questions from a larger pool rather than making do with the first handful of questions that came to mind.
Work ahead of time. Don’t put off research for the last second, as you may run into a time crunch
Organize a team of researchers. Draw on the strengths of each individual researcher and delegate specific categories to them. For example, researchers with scientific backgrounds should develop science-themed questions, which researchers with English backgrounds should develop literature-themed questions.
Follow a research schedule. Don’t allow yourself to get off track during the week if you plan a weekly show. After delegating responsibility to your research team (or simply concretizing the categories for yourself), set deadlines for when questions will be due.
For example, if you have a team, you might set a mid-week deadline for a pool of questions three times the size of what you need for the episode. Two days before the episode, you must winnow that pool down to the questions you will actually use that week.

, Although you can find websites where trivia-type questions are provided fairly easily, you should only use them as a last resort, because everyone has access to that same bank of generic questions.Audiences and contestants will be far more engaged with interesting, challenging questions that can’t be found in a generic trivia bank, but which you or your team found through thoughtful research.

, When developing your questions, keep your audience in mind. Steer clear of topics that might bore them; for example, an entire category devoted to the periodic table of elements might get tiresome.


Consider who you’re writing this show for. Depending on your demographic, you’ll need to develop different strategies to attract viewer interest.
If the show is geared toward teenagers, you can develop questions about pop music, movies, or young adult novels.
If the show meant for people who wish to watch academically rigorous competition, focus on the types of subjects taught in university classes: philosophy, political science, etc.
Questions about topical events and stories currently in the news can also make your viewers perk up.

, If the questions are consistently too difficult for your contestants to answer, you might see a decrease in potential contestants. Furthermore, the audience will likely grow bored with the show if contestants are consistently unable to field the questions.


While it’s good to have challenging questions from time to time — ones that are designed to stump everyone — the majority of your questions should skirt the fine line between challenging and obscure.
You can rank the questions within each category by difficulty, beginning with easier questions and building up to more difficult ones.

, Although the talent of your contestants is the real selling point in this genre of game show, you also want to vary the challenges enough to both keep them on their heels and keep your audience engaged. Before you even begin filming your pilot episode, plan out the challenges you want your contestants to complete for the entire season of your show.

, Many performance competition game shows focus on skills that have a revered tradition with well-loved classics. If your game show falls into this category, the people who watch your show might respond well to watching modern-day contestants pay homage to the tradition of their art.


For a cooking game show, have contestants recreate classical dishes with a long tradition, such as chicken cordon bleu or a croquembouche.For a singing game show, have contestants sing old standards that demonstrate their ability to step into a song imbued with someone else’s legacy — Aretha Franklin’s “Chain of Fools” or Frank Sinatra’s “New York, New York,” for example.

, While it takes a great deal of skill to execute a classical standard, asking your contestants to bring their own personality and point of view to a well-loved classic presents an interesting challenge.


For a dancing game show, you might ask competitors to create new choreography for a song that has a beloved performance already associated with it — Gene Kelly’s performance of “Singing in the Rain,” for example., While you want to design many of your challenges to highlight your contestants’ creativity and innovation, showcasing their technical skills can also enthrall viewers.


For a dancing game show, see how many pirouette turns dancers can do without losing their balance, for example.

, Sometimes, it’s hard to challenge a skilled batch of contestants. A good way to put pressure on them when challenging their technical abilities is to place a time restriction on their task.


For a cooking game show, for example, you might see which contestant can Brunoise dice a pile of vegetables most quickly with an even cut., Though some of the challenges can be about technical proficiency, design other challenges to set contestants up in a way that allows them to showcase their personalities.


On a cooking game show, you might ask contestants to cook a dish that speaks to them from their childhood.
On a singing game show, you might challenge the contestants to compose their own songs rather than simply perform those of others.

, In some fields, such as singing and dancing, it may be more difficult to demonstrate innovation because the performers are not necessarily the ones composing or choreographing the pieces. However, if your show showcases a field where your contestants can push the envelope in their industry, design challenges that lead them toward innovation.


For a fashion design game show, ask contestants to create an evening look geared toward women ten years from now.
For a cooking show, ask contestants to deconstruct a simple dish or simplify a complex dish.

, Although you want your contestants to be able to demonstrate their own personalities and styles, you also want to see how they can adapt to a wide variety of constraints.


For a dancing game show, have them work in styles from ballet to hip hop to classical Indian folk dance.
Have cooking game show contestants cook vegan dishes one week, then break down and butcher sides of beef for their own steak dishes the next.

, There are a number of different ways you can test contestants’ strength in that are more entertaining than simply having them lift weights in a gym. Some examples might include:


Putting them through a classic childhood exercise like a wheelbarrow race; not only do the contestants have to prove their arm strength over a long distance, but the audience can enjoy laughing along with grown contestants engaging in childish games.Recreate a fun state fair environment by having contestants throw balls at targets for prizes; however, the balls should be heavy medicine balls, and the targets should be far away.
Use your imagination — there are any number of ways to have fun while challenging muscle strength.

, You can have them compete head on in simple racing heats, or you can make it a little more interesting by asking them to complete unrelated tasks during their race. For example, contestants sprint for 50 yards, solve a riddle that’s taped to a card at the 50 yard point, sprint back to the starting point, solve a math problem, sprint up a deck of stadium stairs, recite the alphabet backwards, then sprint back to the starting point. Again, you can jazz up the contest however you want, but you want to showcase your contestants’ speed.

, This skill set might have the most potential for entertainment value in a game show setting. You might have contestants engage in an old fashioned pie toss, a dunk tank, or an overgrown, amped up game of dodgeball. A bonus round challenge might be to award extra points to whichever contestant can hit a full-court basketball shot first.

, Obstacle courses raise the stakes by forcing contestants out of their comfort zone. You might set up a military-style outdoor obstacle course, with climbing walls, balance beams, lift-and-carry exercises, and dead sprints.You might aim instead for a funnier tone, booby-trapping contestants with water balloons or flour bombs at points throughout the obstacle course.


The benefit of an obstacle course is that it tests many elements of your contestants’ fitness at the same time, rather than isolating strength from speed from coordination.
Make sure your contestants are safe at all times. Use rubber pads on any hard walls or objects contestants might run into, and don’t aim projectiles at them that could inflict injury if it made contact.

, Whether you’re trying to sell your game show to a major network or local broadcast television, or even just filming it to upload on Youtube, you will need help from a team of people to make your game show a reality. You will need, at minimum:


Camera operators — you need enough camera angles to show the host and all of the contestants. If you have individual contestants, you might just need two camera operators — one for the host and one for all of the contestants. However, if you have multiple teams, you might need a camera operator dedicated to each team.
A production editor — someone who is familiar with video production software like Adobe Premiere Pro or Final Cut.
A sound technician — someone who can ensure that the sound quality of all the dialogue on the show is picked up clearly.
A charismatic host — the host you choose will set the tone for your show. Whether you pay someone, ask a friend to help you out, or go for it yourself, you need to make sure that the host brings a high level of energy to the proceedings

, The host should introduce each contestant by name, asking them to share a little about themselves. This biographical information can be cut and dry (“My name is Amy, and I’m an accountant for the city of Austin”) or more whimsical (“My name is Amy, and I have a cat who likes to go hiking with me on a leash every weekend”).

, Even if your show has been running for a while, you may have new viewers on a given week who are unfamiliar with it. It’s a good practice to introduce the show by briefly explaining the rules and format of the game at the top of each to make sure everyone knows what’s going on.


Create a set script for the introductory rule explanation. This will both ensure that the rules are clearly stated every episode and create a comfortable, familiar segue into the episode for returning viewers.

, If this is a televised show, there will be consistent breaks for commercials — but even if your show is online, it’s a good idea to allow resting spots every once in a while, ideally between rounds.


When a round ends, the host should recap the scores at that point in the game.
This is a good time for the host to comment on how the game is going so far, or to ask the contestants how they’re feeling about their performance.
These little breaks will give both the audience and the contestants time to reset for the next round of competition.

, If your show has a format that changes from round to round, make sure your host explains the new rules at the beginning of each round. You might have a stable format for each different round, like Jeopardy or Chopped, or you might have completely different challenges in each round from week to week, like Project Runway or Top Chef.

, The audience wants to like the people they’re watching, especially the host who remains a constant from episode to episode. Make sure the host is personable throughout, joking with contestants, complimenting them when they do something well, and allowing them to display their personalities.

, As each episode draws to a close, the host should thank the contestants for participating and congratulate the winner on their victory. Take a brief moment before the show ends to thank the audience for watching the show, and invite them to join you again for your next episode. Tell them the date, time, and channel on which the show appears so they know exactly when and where they can find the next episode.

Drones are new technology that is being used by many different types of people, including hobbyists who fly them around their backyards or in parks to take pictures/videos as well as commercial companies using them for business purposes such as filming events like weddings.  Drone use has been increasing over time because they can be cheaper than hiring an aircraft company (such as Red Bull) which uses helicopters and/or airplanes to get aerial footage/photos from high up above ground level. People have always flown RC planes and helicopters but not nearly at this scale where there were only a few hundred thousand registered drone owners worldwide compared to millions flying RC planes/helicopters each year.   The main difference between these two technologies is how much damage they could cause if something goes wrong while they're in flight since most RC plane crashes don't result in any injuries whereas some drone crashes have resulted in deaths due to the fact that they carry cameras on board along with other electronics making it more likely for someone to lose control when operating them	1
"Well let me start by saying that I'm not an expert in classical music by any stretch but I did go to college as part of the Recording Industry Managment program at MTSU, specializing in Pro/Tech, so I feel that I can add something to the conversation.

the thing about classical music is that it has already been writen and there isn't much room for deviation from the written music while performing in and orchestral setting, if you listen to a full arrangement by different orchestras the music will almost always be extreamly similar.

Yoyo has found a way to express himself *within* the written music, he adds emotion to the music without changing the underlying arrangements that we know and love.

Think of it like this, in the world of music, covers are normally not as good as the original because the artist changed it and the song isn't what people expected anymore (rythemic, lyrical, or key changes) yet if a skilled/talented artist does the cover they add to the song without changing it to the point of being unrecognizable.  Yoyo found a way through his love and passion for classical music to add to the music without taking anything away in the process.

The best way to tell the difference would be to listen to a full orchestral version of the music made by someone else then listen the him play the same thing, at least for me I can feel the difference, the passion for what he does seeps into the music and infuses it with emotion.


Edit:  > to simplify: If classical music is ""Hurt"" by Nine Inch nails, Yo-Yo Ma is Johnny Cash.

"  Mobile entities with wireless links are able to form a mobile ad-hoc network.
Such an infrastructureless network does not have to be administrated. However,
self-organizing principles have to be applied to deal with upcoming problems,
e.g. information dissemination. These kinds of problems are not easy to tackle,
requiring complex algorithms. Moreover, the usefulness of pure ad-hoc networks
is arguably limited. Hence, enthusiasm for mobile ad-hoc networks, which could
eliminate the need for any fixed infrastructure, has been damped. The goal is
to overcome the limitations of pure ad-hoc networks by augmenting them with
instant Internet access, e.g. via integration of UMTS respectively GSM links.
However, this raises multiple questions at the technical as well as the
organizational level. Motivated by characteristics of small-world networks that
describe an efficient network even without central or organized design, this
paper proposes to combine mobile ad-hoc networks and infrastructured networks
to form hybrid wireless networks. One main objective is to investigate how this
approach can reduce the costs of a permanent backbone link and providing in the
same way the benefits of useful information from Internet connectivity or
service providers. For the purpose of bridging between the different types of
networks, an adequate middleware service is the focus of our investigation.
This paper shows our first steps forward to this middleware by introducing the
Injection Communication paradigm as principal concept.

"The authors present their work well with clear explanations.  They also provide some interesting experiments showing how they are using this approach.
I think there could still be room for improvement though - I would like more details about what exactly was transferred between each experiment as opposed to just saying ""transfer"" without any further explanation. Also, if possible I'd love to see results where the number of source tasks were varied so we know whether it's better to use one large set vs many small sets etc... Overall good job! 
Reviewer: David Silverman, University College London & Imperial College London. Reviewer ID: dsilverma@ucl.ac.uk  This article presents a novel method for adaptive transfer across related environments/tasks within the same domain. It proposes an attention-based neural network architecture called Attend-Adapt-Transfer (A2T) capable of avoiding negative transfer whilst simultaneously selecting relevant information from various source tasks at every step during training. In addition, the proposed framework allows both policy and value function adaptation through parameter sharing mechanisms. Finally, extensive experimental evaluation shows that our proposal outperforms existing methods under varying conditions including multi-source transfer scenarios."	1

"  One of the great quests of astronomy is to obtain the spectrum of a
terrestrial planet orbiting within the habitable zone of its star, and the
dominant challenge in doing so is to isolate the light of the planet from that
of the star. Dynamics-based methods separate these signals temporally, whereas
imaging techniques do so spatially. In light of the overwhelming dominance of
dynamics-based methods over the past decade, we challenge the notion that
spectra of terrestrial planets necessarily require extreme imaging methods. We
advocate that some resources be committed to refining the proven technologies
of radial-velocity measurements, transit photometry, and occultation
spectroscopy (i.e. emergent infrared spectra obtained at secondary eclipse). We
see a particularly attractive opportunity in M-dwarfs, for which the habitable
zone is close to the star, increasing the probability and frequency of
transits, and the amplitude of the induced radial-velocity variation. Such
planets could be discovered by a dedicated ground-based transit survey of the
10,000 nearest M-dwarfs. The favorable planet-star contrast ratio would make
these planets ideal targets for the study of their atmospheres with the
technique of occultation spectroscopy.

" Patapons will be celebrating a dancing around the fire. Others giving you advice. Keep pressing button to carry on. The PSP keypad will now pop up. It may ask you for either for your name or like naming the tribe but it's all in Japanese, so type anything and press start to continue. It will say if you want to save, so do so. After that talk to the one with the cloak., selects things. Press to save and click the top option to do save or the bottom option to not save. The button is if you want to quit. Bottom option is no, top one is yes to quit. For both screens.,, , scroll left and right. goes back and selects a level. You will only be able to do the first square at the moment. Press to enter it.,
Button goes to the last screen.

Highlights stuff.
Hides things.
Button brings up units status.
The squad status screen shows your total squad status all together.
Highlight your Patapons with the D - pad press triangle and you will been on the unit status section. This screen shows stats for each Patapon. with D - pad you can select a Patapon and then by pressing up or down select either the weapon icon or helmet icon and press to select it. This will open a box where you can select weapons and items etc. You won’t have any to select at the moment so press to go back. Play around with the options until you get comfortable with it and press the button when you’re ready to start the mission.

,

New Sequence: = Attack.
Voice: Pon Pon Pata Pon.
Enemies: Three birds and four pigs.
You now have a new button sequence, Pon Pon Pata Pon. This makes your Patapon attack in this case throw spears at the wall. You can practice your Pata Pata Pata Pon instead but they won’t move but you can build a fever up by getting 10 combo points. Anyway attack the wall by doing keep on doing it until you destroyed the way you can build up combos with this one too. Remember to do the next one only after the Patapons have finished singing. After you have destroyed the wall do your victory dance by keep on doing Pon Pon Pata Pon four more times in a row after that move on forward with Pata Pata Pata Pon. when you get near the totem pole you will notice that it has symbols but you can't do anything there at the moment so keep on going. if you see enemies like birds and other things don’t stop to close because less advantage for you. attack and try to kill them if you can, sometimes helps if you're in a fever (10 combo points). you do more damage in a fever. the birds you see do run away easily.
You can get combos by doing Pata Pata Pata Pon, and then doing Pon Pon Pata Pon, it doesn’t have to be the same one each time. The more combo points you have the more damage you do. You can get coins from the sunflowers and enemies if they get destroyed while you’re attacking. Move over the coins to collect them. All the enemies on this level run away and don’t attack so don’t be afraid to attack them. Keep moving forward and attacking to get to the flag pillar and the end of the mission. Mission Complete!
On the mission complete screen you will see the Patapons carrying on carts the beasts you killed back to their home.
Another information screen will pop up.

, Talk to the Patapon with the cloak that is standing next to what looks like a shrine. Click on the shrine and this will take you to a screen with the items you have collected like how many spears you have and how much food you have from the beasts you have killed and lots more. Also how many coins you have is on the top right. Press to go back. Click on the big black pillar when you want to go to the world map and the next mission., You might want to build up a fever to do more damage. The 4 Zigotron behind the wall will move right behind the next wall what is next to another wall. A Patapon with a sword and shield will come out of the bush and join your group. Destroy the next wall will your group (your new Patapon is very strong). While destroying the walls watch out for enemy Zigotron. Just keep on moving right destroying the walls and the enemy and collecting the items as you go. Destroy the small black pillar then the small house. After that your new Patapon will die and turn into a butterfly. Pick the items it drops and go through the end of level flag. Mission Complete!

, When you select it, a menu opens up showing the Patapons you can make, how much you have all together, how much it cost to make a specific Patapon, and what items are need e.g. to make a spear Patapon you need meat, wood, and 80 coins. The circles show how many of each Patapon you already have., You need to press circle in time to make the tree shake and drop an item. If you fail you can try again but you need to give one piece of meat again. when you hear the person go for example Pon Pon Pon when he finishes you press circle, circle, circle and so on. Listen to what the person says, if it says four words you have to press the circle button four times but you have to do it in the same tempo as the singer. Once you done that you will get the items you need (wood).
The sequence is: O/O/O O/O/O O/O/OO O/O/OO O/OO/OO O/OO/OO O/O/O O/O/OO
If you get stuck just talk to the Patapon with a cape.
You have to pass the tree mini-game so if you fail it and don’t have any meat you have to play a previous level to collect some meat. You will know that the level contains meat because it will have a meat symbol on the world map. So play the level with the meat symbol and get some meat by killing beasts and completing the level. In this game it’s good to play over the old levels and a lot of the time is required.
Once you have passed and got a branch, make a spear Patapon, you will notice that it is all orange. Then make sure it’s on your team then play the second square on the world map.

, You will have to fight lots of Zigotron now, there not that hard if you have an axe Patapon because it will go up front and take all the damage while you’re attacking with your spear throwers behind. this is probably be the first time you get a proper fever going and maybe the first time a Patapon dies none did for me though. Keep on moving forward and attacking the enemy and trying to keep the combos going till you get to the end. Destroy the building and go through the flag. Mission complete!
Remember to upgrade your Patapons with better weapons when you can.

, Destroy the first wall, then take out the tower, watch out for the archers on the tower and the other Zigotron patrolling below it once they're all dead and building destroyed a Patapon archer will appear. for the next bit do the same tactic as before and destroy the wall, tower, house and the next tower if you see a green potion pick it up, it restores your Patapons life. If you get fever going it won’t take long to kill them all. The archer you got fires fire arrows which can set the Zigotron a light this makes them run around and not fight back. After you they're all dead and buildings destroyed, move forward. Destroy the black pillar. When you get near the house the bow Patapon will die and turn into a butterfly pick up the items it drops, destroy the building and go through the flag. Mission complete!
You can now make archers.

, This level might be hard if you’re not prepared because of the tough grim reaper type Zigotron you face, it keeps on attacking you with tornadoes which make your Patapons jump in the air and get hurt. In the middle is a Patapon trapped in a cage; you need to save him too so make sure you don’t kill him by accident. Keep on moving forward and attacking the enemy, having fever is very helpful and picking up green potions. Your probably won't are able to kill the boss here because it will probably run away from you. Mission complete!
To defeat the boss coming up you will need a lot of Patapons so do the second square, the one with the meat icon a few times to build up a bigger squad and use the best equipment you have available. Also do the tree mini game if you need more wood.

,
Go forward and destroy the pillar. You will get a new drum Chaka and a new sequence Chaka Chaka Pata Pon. Does the new sequence a few times, when ready keep moving forward. When the fire breathing dragon comes use Chaka Chaka Pata Pon each time, this makes you defend and attack. Only the Patapons with shields defend. If Patapons die make sure you pick up there helmets and just keep on attacking with Chaka Chaka Pata Pon. It isn’t that hard if you got the most Patapons you can get at the moment. I had 11 Patapons, 3 axes, 6 spears and 1 archer.
If any Patapons died, make sure you reborn them when you get back to your village. You do this by going to the heart shaped tree.

, If you go past it, you will start burning and dying very quickly because of the extreme heat of the desert. You will need something to cool it down., I don’t know if it needs to be raining for it to work., Basically the same as the last boss fight but a bit harder. Keep on attacking with Chaka Chaka Pata Pon. Your Patapons might get eaten so watch out for that. Keep attacking if your entire shields Patapons die then attack using Pon Pon Pata Pon. Keep at it and it should die eventually. The boss dragon drops a rain item.

,
New Sequence: = miracle
Voice: Don DoDon DoDon
Do the rain miracle at the start. You have to be in fever to do it. If you can’t do it, practice a lot. After that move forward to the tower. Destroy the tower then keep moving forward. You will see beasts that you can attack also one will have a blue symbol on it, if you attack that one it will turn into a snail. When you get tot he talking sign destroy the rock in front and get fever. Once the rock in front is destroyed use rain miracle then move forward and destroy the rocks and keep on moving forward. you need to try to keep fever going so you can use the rain miracle straight away or if you move forward really quickly and destroying the rocks as you go you can get out the desert with only doing the rain miracle once but you will lose a lot of Patapons this way so make sure you pick up the helmets they drop. Keep going forward destroy the building at the end and go through the flagpole.

,, They will attack in groups and each group has two zigotrons on horses. This levels isn’t that hard if you use all the things you have learned so far like knowing when to attack and charge or when to hold your ground. When they are near most of the time its best to use the defend command. When they are not near use the attack command. Make sure you try to stay in fever for most of the time because this will help you do more damage. Make sure you pick up the green potions they drop. When you get near the end you will see zigotrons hiding in the bushes. Also near the end lots of them will attack if you are in fever and you use the attack command they will run away and retreat. So you don’t have to kill all of them near the end. Destroy the building then go through the flagpole.,, Do the rain miracle at the start. Move forward and you will see a blue beast, hit it and it will turn into a snail now all you have to do is kill the snail. Make sure you are in fever mode most of the time and keep on attacking. If it gets to far make sure you move forward with it and keep on attacking. When it dies it will drop a hat pick it up and go through the flagpole at the end., You will now have a new mini game. You can select the new mini game by pressing to get to it.,, When the game starts keep on pressing in time with the flashing sides or at a steady pace. While you do this the farmer will plant flowers, water flowers and do stuff with the big flower when this is done the big flower will talk to you. This is to allow you to get ready for the next bit. When your farmer is holding a leaf over its head, keep on pressing fast and if done right the farmer will catch a big cabbage. Well done you have completed the flower mini game., Make sure you have lots of Patapons with good equipment. This boss fight can be hard but if you have lots of Patapons it isn’t as hard, the boss does three attacks. A fire attack when it breaths in air. A head attack when it raises its head and a ground attack when it lies on the ground. When the boss is about to do an attack do the defend command then after that do the attack command. If you keep in fever most of the time and defend when it attacks and attack when it isn’t then you can beat it quite easy. When its eyes start to flash that means its going to die soon.,,, horse squad for the archer squad etc., Also you need to watch out for the zigotron army who are out in force to stop you. They are quite easy to defeat if you make sure your Patapons are up to the job and you have quite a lot of them. Make sure to remember all the tactics you have learned and use them in battle.,, You will see a zigotron that looks like a grim reaper. You don’t have to kill it. All you need to do is kill all the zigotron that are hiding in the bushes. The easiest way is to get fever going and keep on attacking. A big zigotron will come and attack in the middle of the battle but is easy to kill. After there all dead the grim reaper zigotron will retreat so all is left to do is go through the flagpole. If you fail the first time try again and you’re more likely to complete it."	0

"Norfloxacin, sold under the brand name Noroxin among others, is an antibiotic that belongs to the class of fluoroquinolone antibiotics. It is used to treat urinary tract infections, gynecological infections, inflammation of the prostate gland, gonorrhea and bladder infection. Eye drops were approved for use in children older than one year of age.

Norfloxacin is associated with a number of rare serious adverse reactions as well as spontaneous tendon ruptures and irreversible peripheral neuropathy. Tendon problems may manifest long after therapy had been completed and in severe cases may result in lifelong disabilities.

It was patented in 1977 and approved for medical use in 1983.

Medical uses
The initial approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1986 encompassed the following indications:

Uncomplicated urinary tract infections (including cystitis)
Complicated urinary tract infections (restricted use) 
Uncomplicated urethral and cervical gonorrhea (however this indication is no longer considered to be effective by some experts due to bacterial resistance) 
Prostatitis due to Escherichia coli.
Syphilis treatment: Norfloxacin has not been shown to be effective in the treatment of syphilis.  Antimicrobial agents used in high doses for short periods of time to treat gonorrhea may mask or delay the symptoms of incubating syphilis.

Although fluoroquinolones are sometimes used to treat typhoid and paratyphoid fever, norfloxacin had more clinical failures than the other fluoroquinolones (417 participants, 5 trials).

In ophthalmology, Norfloxacin licensed use is limited to the treatment of conjunctival infections caused by susceptible bacteria.

Norfloxacin has been restricted in the Republic of Ireland due to the risks of C. difficile super infections and permanent nerve as well as tendon injuries. It licensed use in acute and chronic complicated kidney infections has been withdrawn as a result.

The European Medicines Agency, also in 2008, had recommended restricting the use of oral norfloxacin to treat urinary infections. CHMP had concluded that the marketing authorizations for norfloxacin, when used in the treatment of acute or chronic complicated pyelonephritis, should be withdrawn because the benefits do not outweigh their risks in this indication. CHMP stated that doctors should not prescribe oral norfloxacin for complicated pyelonephritis and should consider switching patients already taking oral norfloxacin for this type of infection to an alternative antibiotic.

Norfloxacin is used for prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhotic patients who have a low ascites fluid protein level, impaired renal function, severe liver disease, have had a prior episode of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, or esophageal variceal bleeding.

Note: Norfloxacin may be licensed for other uses, or restricted, by the various regulatory agencies worldwide.

Contraindications
As noted above, under licensed use, norfloxacin is also now considered to be contraindicated for the treatment of certain sexually transmitted diseases by some experts due to bacterial resistance.

Norfloxacin is contraindicated in those with a history of tendonitis, tendon rupture and those with a hypersensitivity to fluoroquinolones.

There are three contraindications found within the 2008 package insert:

""Noroxin (norfloxacin) is contraindicated in persons with a history of hypersensitivity, tendinitis, or tendon rupture associated with the use of norfloxacin or any member of the quinolone group of antimicrobial agents.""
""Quinolones, including norfloxacin, have been shown in vitro to inhibit CYP1A2. Concomitant use with drugs metabolized by CYP1A2 (e.g., caffeine, clozapine, ropinirole, tacrine, theophylline, tizanidine) may result in increased substrate drug concentrations when given in usual doses. Patients taking any of these drugs concomitantly with norfloxacin should be carefully monitored.""
""Concomitant administration with tizanidine is contraindicated""

Norfloxacin is also considered to be contraindicated within the pediatric population.

Pregnancy
Norfloxacin has been reported to rapidly cross the blood-placenta and blood-milk barrier, and is extensively distributed into the fetal tissues. For this reason norfloxacin and other fluoroquinolones are contraindicated during pregnancy due to the risk of spontaneous abortions and birth defects. The fluoroquinolones have also been reported as being present in the mother's milk and are passed on to the nursing child, which may increases the risk of the child suffering an adverse reaction even though the child had never been prescribed or taken any of the drugs found within this class. As safer alternatives are generally available norfloxacin is contraindicated during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester. The manufacturer only recommends use of norfloxacin during pregnancy when benefit outweighs risk.

Children
A 1998 retrospective survey found that numerous side effects have been recorded in reference to the unapproved use of norfloxacin in the pediatric population.
Fluoroquinolones are not licensed by the FDA for use in children due to the risk of fatalities as well as permanent injury to the musculoskeletal system, with two exceptions. Ciprofloxacin is being licensed for the treatment of Complicated Urinary Tract Infections and Pyelonephritis due to Escherichia coli and Inhalational Anthrax (post-exposure) and levofloxacin was recently licensed for the treatment of Inhalational Anthrax (post-exposure). However, the Fluoroquinolones are licensed to treat lower respiratory infections in children with cystic fibrosis in the UK.

Adverse effects
In general, fluoroquinolones are well tolerated, with most side-effects being mild to moderate.  On occasion, serious adverse effects occur. Common side-effects include gastrointestinal effects such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, as well as headache and insomnia.

The overall rate of adverse events in patients treated with fluoroquinolones is roughly similar to that seen in patients treated with other antibiotic classes. A U.S. Centers for Disease Control study found patients treated with fluoroquinolones experienced adverse events severe enough to lead to an emergency department visit more frequently than those treated with cephalosporins or macrolides, but less frequently than those treated with penicillins, clindamycin, sulfonamides, or vancomycin.

Post-marketing surveillance has revealed a variety of relatively rare but serious adverse effects that are associated with all members of the fluoroquinolone antibacterial class. Among these, tendon problems and exacerbation of the symptoms of the neurological disorder myasthenia gravis are the subject of ""black box"" warnings in the United States. The most severe form of tendonopathy associated with fluoroquinolone administration is tendon rupture, which in the great majority of cases involves the Achilles tendon. Younger people typically experience good recovery, but permanent disability is possible, and is more likely in older patients.  The overall frequency of fluoroquinolone-associated Achilles tendon rupture in patients treated with ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin has been estimated at 17 per 100,000 treatments. Risk is substantially elevated in the elderly and in those with recent exposure to topical or systemic corticosteroid therapy. Simultaneous use of corticosteroids is present in almost one-third of quinolone-associated tendon rupture. Tendon damage may manifest during, as well as up to a year after fluoroquinolone therapy has been completed.

FQs prolong the QT interval by blocking voltage-gated potassium channels. Prolongation of the QT interval can lead to torsades de pointes, a life-threatening arrhythmia, but in practice this appears relatively uncommon in part because the most widely prescribed fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin) only minimally prolong the QT interval.

Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea may occur in connection with the use of any antibacterial drug, especially those with a broad spectrum of activity such as clindamycin, cephalosporins, and fluoroquinolones. Fluoroquinoline treatment is associated with risk that is similar to or less  than that associated with broad spectrum cephalosporins. Fluoroquinoline administration may be associated with the acquisition and outgrowth of a particularly virulent Clostridium strain.

The U.S. prescribing information contains a warning regarding uncommon cases of peripheral neuropathy, which can be permanent. Other nervous system effects include insomnia, restlessness, and rarely, seizure, convulsions, and psychosis Other rare and serious adverse events have been observed with varying degrees of evidence for causation.

Events that may occur in acute overdose are rare, and include kidney failure and seizure. Susceptible groups of patients, such as children and the elderly, are at greater risk of adverse reactions during therapeutic use.

Interactions
The toxicity of drugs that are metabolised by the cytochrome P450 system is enhanced by concomitant use of some quinolones. Quinolones, including norfloxacin, may enhance the effects of oral anticoagulants, including warfarin or its derivatives or similar agents. When these products are administered concomitantly, prothrombin time or other suitable coagulation tests should be closely monitored. Coadministration may dangerously increase coumadin warfarin activity; INR should be monitored closely.

They may also interact with the GABA A receptor and cause neurological symptoms; this effect is augmented by certain non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. 
The concomitant administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with a quinolone, including norfloxacin, may increase the risk of CNS stimulation and convulsive seizures. Therefore, norfloxacin should be used with caution in individuals receiving NSAIDS concomitantly.

Elevated serum levels of cyclosporine have been reported with concomitant use of cyclosporine with norfloxacin. Therefore, cyclosporine serum levels should be monitored and appropriate cyclosporine dosage adjustments made when these drugs are used concomitantly.

The concomitant administration of quinolones including norfloxacin with glyburide (a sulfonylurea agent) has, on rare occasions, resulted in severe hypoglycemia. Therefore, monitoring of blood glucose is recommended when these agents are co-administered.

Medications

Some quinolones exert an inhibitory effect on the cytochrome P-450 system, thereby reducing theophylline clearance and increasing theophylline blood levels. Coadministration of certain fluoroquinolones and other drugs primarily metabolized by CYP1A2 (e.g. theophylline, methylxanthines, tizanidine) results in increased plasma concentrations and could lead to clinically significant side effects of the coadministered drug. Additionally other fluoroquinolones, especially enoxacin, and to a lesser extent ciprofloxacin and pefloxacin, also inhibit the metabolic clearance of theophylline.

Such drug interactions are associated with the molecular structural modifications of the quinolone ring, specifically interactions involving NSAIDS and theophylline.  As such, these drug interactions involving the fluoroquinolones appear to be drug specific rather than a class effect.  The fluoroquinolones have also been shown to interfere with the metabolism of caffeine and the absorption of levothyroxine. The interference with the metabolism of caffeine may lead to the reduced clearance of caffeine and a prolongation of its serum half-life, resulting in a caffeine overdose.  This may lead to reduced clearance of caffeine and a prolongation of the plasma's half-life that may lead to accumulation of caffeine in plasma when products containing caffeine are consumed while taking norfloxacin.

The use of NSAIDs (Non Steroid Anti Inflammatory Drugs) while undergoing fluoroquinolone therapy is contra-indicated due to the risk of severe CNS adverse reactions, including but not limited to seizure disorders. Fluoroquinolones with an unsubstituted piperazinyl moiety at position 7 have the potential to interact with NSAIDs and/or their metabolites, resulting in antagonism of GABA neurotransmission.

The use of norfloxacin concomitantly has also been associated with transient elevations in serum creatinine in patients receiving cyclosporine, on rare occasions, resulted in severe hypoglycemia with sulfonylurea. Renal tubular transport of methotrexate may be inhibited by concomitant administration of norfloxacin, potentially leading to increased plasma levels of methotrexate. This might increase the risk of methotrexate toxic reactions.

Current or past treatment with oral corticosteroids is associated with an increased risk of Achilles tendon rupture, especially in elderly patients who are also taking the fluoroquinolones.

Overdose

Treatment of overdose includes emptying of the stomach via induced vomiting or by gastric lavage. Careful monitoring and supportive treatment, monitoring of renal and liver function, and maintaining adequate hydration is recommended by the manufacturer. Administration of magnesium, aluminum, or calcium containing antacids can reduce the absorption of norfloxacin.

Mechanism of action
Norfloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.  It functions by inhibiting DNA gyrase, a type II topoisomerase, and topoisomerase IV, enzymes necessary to separate bacterial DNA, thereby inhibiting cell division. Norfloxacin does not bind to DNA gyrase but does bind to the substrate DNA.  A review in 2001 suggests that cytotoxicity of fluoroquinolones is likely a 2-step process involving (1) conversion of the topoisomerase-quinolone-DNA complex to an irreversible form and (2) generation of a double-strand break by denaturation of the topoisomerase.

Pharmacokinetics

“Absorption of norfloxacin is rapid following single doses of 200 mg, 400 mg and 800 mg. At the respective doses, mean peak serum and plasma concentrations of 0.8, 1.5 and 2.4 μg/mL are attained approximately one hour after dosing. The effective half-life of norfloxacin in serum and plasma is 3–4 hours. Steady-state concentrations of norfloxacin will be attained within two days of dosing.  Renal excretion occurs by both glomerular filtration and tubular secretion as evidenced by the high rate of renal clearance (approximately 275 mL/min). Within 24 hours of drug administration, 26 to 32% of the administered dose is recovered in the urine as norfloxacin with an additional 5-8% being recovered in the urine as six active metabolites of lesser antimicrobial potency. Only a small percentage (less than 1%) of the dose is recovered thereafter. Fecal recovery accounts for another 30% of the administered dose.  Two to three hours after a single 400-mg dose, urinary concentrations of 200 μg/mL or more are attained in the urine. In healthy volunteers, mean urinary concentrations of norfloxacin remain above 30 μg/mL for at least 12 hours following a 400-mg dose. The urinary pH may affect the solubility of norfloxacin. Norfloxacin is least soluble at urinary pH of 7.5 with greater solubility occurring at pHs above and below this value. The serum protein binding of norfloxacin is between 10 and 15%.” Quoting from the 2009 package insert for Noroxin.

Biotransformation is via the liver and kidneys, with a half-life of 3–4 hours.

History
The first members of the quinolone antibacterial class were relatively low potency drugs such as nalidixic acid, used mainly in the treatment of urinary tract infections owing to their renal excretion and propensity to be concentrated in urine.  In 1979 the publication of a patent filed by the pharmaceutical arm of Kyorin Seiyaku Kabushiki Kaisha disclosed the discovery of norfloxacin, and the demonstration that certain structural modifications including the attachment of a fluorine atom to the quinolone ring leads to dramatically enhanced antibacterial potency.

In spite of the substantial increase in antibacterial activity of norfloxacin relative to early fluoroquinolones, it did not become a widely used antibiotic. Other companies initiated fluoroquinolone discovery programs in the aftermath of the publication of the norfloxacin patent. Bayer Pharmaceuticals discovered that the addition of a single carbon atom to the norfloxacin structure provided another 4 to 10-fold improvement in activity.  Ciprofloxacin reached the market just one year after norfloxacin and achieved sales of 1.5 billion Euros at its peak.

Kyorin granted Merck & Company, Inc., an exclusive license (in certain countries, including the United States), to import and distribute Norfloxacin under the brand name Noroxin. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Noroxin for distribution in the United States on October 31, 1986.

Availability
In most countries, all formulations require a prescription. In Colombia (South America) it is marketed under Ambigram from Laboratorios Bussié

Noroxin was discontinued in the US as of April 2014

"The game's designers are not always aware of all possible ways that players will interact with their creations, and sometimes they make mistakes or oversights when creating levels and/or maps. This can lead to situations where it becomes impossible (or nearly so) to complete certain objectives within those levels because there simply isn't enough information available about how to do them correctly. For example, if you fall off an edge into nothingness then there's no way back up without restarting your entire adventure from scratch! The same goes for jumping down a hole only to find yourself at ground level but surrounded by walls on every side - it's just plain frustrating!
Another reason why this happens often has more to do with human nature than anything else; people tend to be lazy creatures who don't like doing things twice over again unless absolutely necessary. If you're playing a first-person shooter and you've already completed one mission successfully once before, chances are you'll try to repeat exactly what worked last time instead of exploring new areas which may have different enemies or obstacles."	1
"At the beginning of the 20th century, it was usual to work 60 hours a week. Then, unions, labour strikes and movements changed that (thankfully) and went down to a 40 hour week. That's what we've been working for 100 years already. Now, with the automation it would be fair to think we're up for a new reduction of the week work.

Some countries such as France have gone down to 35 hours, without seeing much of a change (neither an improvement not a worsening of the work). In some countries they are trying the 6 hour day such as [Sweden](_URL_0_), it's going well for many of them, but nobody does these experiments long enough to actually see results.

3 days a week, 8 hours = 24 hours a week. That's almost the 30 hours a week that the Swedes are trying. 
The [new economics foundation](_URL_1_) actually suggests a 21 hour week.

In general, arguments in favour of reducing the time we work per week is more time for our families, more time for other activities, more time for consuming goods, better work life balance, happy employees, less unemployment. Not everything is producing things (aka working long hours), people need to have the money, the need, the willingness to buy them and the time to use them. That all makes economy boost."	0
"The authors present an interesting approach to metaheuristics, which is based on adaptive imagination and control of search processes in optimization problems.
This work has several advantages over other approaches that are currently used by researchers working with evolutionary algorithms (EA) or swarm intelligence techniques.  The main advantage lies in the fact that this method does not require any additional parameters beyond those already required when using standard EA methods such as genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimizer (PSO). This makes it easier to use than many existing metaheuristic methods. 
Another important feature of this new technique is that it can be easily combined with different types of EAs without requiring significant changes to their structure. 

In addition, unlike most current metaheuristic methods, this one allows you to obtain solutions close to optimal ones even if there were no previous knowledge about them.  

However, I would like to point out some issues related to the proposed research results presented here.   First, although the author claims that his method works well both in continuous spaces..."	1

"The Opuvani do (Serbian: Windy valley) is a sinkhole at the northern slope of the Velika Jastrebica in the Mt Orjen range in Montenegro. It creates a major refugium to arcto-alpine and alpine biota in a region with warm winters. As the 60 m deep sinkhole is prone to cold-air pooling, frequent freeze-thaw cycles create favourable conditions for periglacially formed features (i.e. solifluction, periglacially patterned ground).
The sinkhole is at 1584 m elevation and consists of 4 interconnected sinks. The major sink is laterally elongated, 440 m long. The outflow of the cold air is at 1647 m and the depth of the basin atmosphere is 63 m.

In 2020, a relict population of the Alpine salamander (Salamandra atra) was reported from the sink, which fills a 200 km wide distribution gap in the species range.

Topography and Geology 
The Opuvani do is on Mt Orjen on the Bijela gora, which is part of the High Karst nappe. It is formed of Triassic-Paleogene shallow water calcareous sediments, which were interrupted by a short episode of Middle Triassic deepening and rifting-related volcanism, which is characteristic for the larger Adriatic carbonate platform. It is estimated that the High karst nappe has a recent thrusting of at least 30 km. The Opuvani do is interditated with wide slopes. At its southern part, a fluvioglacial short trench of a paleo-valley (dry valley) leads upslope to the alpine valley that intersects the Jastrebica ridge. The eastern side of the shallow fluvioglacial channel is showing terraces of putative glaviofluvial origin.

The Opuvani do was formed between the axis of the overturned syncline of the Jastrebica ridge and the axis of an oblique anticline in the Opaljika escarpment. Upslope bedrock lithologies of the Jastrebica are composed by upper Cretaceous series of bedded Turonian limestones. Bedded Cenomanian dolomitic limestones appear further downslope. The Opuvani do is embedded in lithologies at the Cenomanian/Turonian border of the High-Karst nappe. It formed in vertical shortened, steep layered, bedded Cenomanian dolomitic limestones. Geological configuration for the paleodoline development is constricted in the folding of the Opaljika (1668 m a.s.l) anticline with bedrocks of lower Cretaceous and upper Jurassic dolomites.

Refugial vegetation 
It was previously assumed that glacial relict/refugial flora are absent in the maritime High-Karst physiographic area with warm winters from the Mount Orjen Range in Montenegro.  After a recent detection of residual arcto-alpine and boreo-alpine biocoenoses (Salicion retusae, Scabioso silenifoliae-Dryadetum octopetalae, Drepanoclado uncinati-Heliospermetum pusillum and Allietum schoenoprasi), 70 km south of known Dinaric inland localities, this assumption was called into question. The reason for the survival of cold loving species in a climate with warm winters is attributed to frequent cold-air pooling, which creates local areas with continental climates.

Climate 

The closest weather station which provides official weather service data is located at Crkvice. As it lies at an elevation of 940 m temperature measurements are not representative to the local microclimate of the sinkhole.

In order to get more precise data for the local basin atmosphere, temperature data loggers had been installed through a funded project at the Department of Geography at the Ludwig Maximilians University Munich since August 2020.

"There is another Town of Lewis in Lewis County, New York.

Lewis is a town in Essex County, New York, United States. The population was 1,382 at the 2010 census. The town is named after Morgan Lewis, the governor of New York at the time the town was established.

The town is in the northeastern quadrant of the county. It is  southwest of Burlington, Vermont,  south of Plattsburgh,  south of Montreal, Quebec, and  north of Albany.

History
Settlement began before 1798 near Lewis village.

The town of Lewis was established in 1805 from a section of the town of Willsboro. Part of Lewis was taken in 1844 and 1854 to increase the size of the town of Elizabethtown.

Iron mining was an important early industry. Both Stowersville and Deerhead were communities based on the iron industry.

The First Congregational Church and Cemetery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.

Notable person
Joseph Call (born March 31, 1781 near Woodstock, Vermont; died September 20, 1835 in Westport, New York), the ""Lewis Giant"", was a strongman and wrestler of widespread fame, as well as a postmaster, millwright, logger, town assessor, auditor, justice of the peace, war veteran and teamster.

Geography
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which  is land and , or 0.25%, is water. The town is drained by tributaries of the Boquet River, flowing east to Lake Champlain.

Lewis is inside the Adirondack Park.

The Northway, Interstate 87, is a major multilane north-south highway, with access from Exit 32 (Stowersville Road). U.S. Route 9 is a north-south highway that passes through the center of town.

The results of Proposition 5 being passed in the November 5 election of 2013 showed New York State to have successfully exchanged 200 acres of land with NYCO Minerals Inc., who will mine said land. The Land was estimated to be worth roughly 1 million dollars.

Demographics

At the 2000 census, there were 1,200 people, 475 households and 341 families residing in the town. The population density was 14.2 per square mile (5.5/km2). There were 620 housing units at an average density of 7.3 per square mile (2.8/km2). The racial makeup of the town was 99.25% White, 0.17% African American, 0.25% Native American, 0.08% from other races, and 0.25% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.08% of the population.

There were 475 households, of which 33.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 56.0% were married couples living together, 10.7% had a female householder with no husband present, and 28.2% were non-families. 21.3% of all households were made up of individuals, and 6.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.53 and the average family size was 2.91.

Age distribution was 27.3% under the age of 18, 5.3% from 18 to 24, 29.9% from 25 to 44, 25.9% from 45 to 64, and 11.5% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 38 years. For every 100 females, there were 110.2 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 103.7 males.

The median household income was $36,750, and the median family income was $37,778. Males had a median income of $28,950 versus $21,750 for females. The per capita income for the town was $17,030. About 5.5% of families and 8.1% of the population were below the poverty line, including 11.2% of those under age 18 and 10.2% of those age 65 or over.

"Chaim Gross (March 17, 1902 – May 5, 1991) was an American sculptor and educator.

Childhood
Gross was born to a Jewish family in Austrian Galicia, in the village of Wolowa (now known as Mezhgorye, Ukraine), in the Carpathian Mountains. In 1911, his family moved to Kolomyia (which was annexed into the Ukrainian SSR in 1939 and became part of newly independent Ukraine in 1991). During World War I, Russian forces invaded Austria-Hungary; amidst the turmoil, the Grosses fled Kolomyia. They returned when Austria retook the town in 1915, refugees of the war. When World War I ended, Gross and brother Avrom-Leib went to Budapest to join their older siblings Sarah and Pinkas.  Gross applied to and was accepted by the art academy in Budapest and studied under the painter Béla Uitz, though within a year a new regime under Miklós Horthy took over and attempted to expel all Jews and foreigners from the country.  After being deported from Hungary, Gross began art studies at the Kunstgewerbeschule in Vienna, Austria shortly before immigrating to the United States in 1921.

Emigration from Austria to U.S.
Gross' brother Naftoli had arrived in New York City in 1914.  He sent money to his brothers Chaim and Avrom-Lieb, who traveled from Vienna to Le Havre, France, where they took a boat to New York City in March 1921.

Early Career 1921-1933
Gross's studies continued in the United States at the Beaux-Arts Institute of Design, where he studied with Elie Nadelman and others, and at the Art Students League of New York, with Robert Laurent.  He also attended the Educational Alliance Art School, studying under Abbo Ostrowsky, at the same time as Moses Soyer, Raphael Soyer, Adolph Gottlieb, and Peter Blume.

In 1926, Gross began teaching at The Educational Alliance, and continued teaching there for the next 50 years.  Louise Nevelson was among his students at the Alliance (in 1934), during the time she was transitioning from painting to sculpture.

Gross began exhibiting sculpture in group shows of students at the Educational Alliance, and then at the Jewish Art Center in the Bronx. In the late 1920s and early 1930s he exhibited at the Salons of America exhibitions at the Anderson Galleries and, beginning in 1928, at the Whitney Studio Club (the precursor to the Whitney Museum of American Art).

In 1929, Gross experimented with printmaking, and created an important group of 15 linocuts and lithographs of landscapes, New York City streets and parks, women in interiors, the circus, and vaudeville. The entire suite is now in the collection of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Gross returned to the medium of printmaking in the 1960s, and produced approximately 200 works in the medium over the next two decades.

In March 1932, Gross had his first solo exhibition at Gallery 144 in New York City.  For a short time they represented Gross, as well as his friends Milton Avery, Moses Soyer, Ahron Ben-Shmuel and others.

Gross was primarily a practitioner of the direct carving method, with the majority of his work being carved from wood. Other direct carvers in early 20th-century American art include William Zorach, Jose de Creeft, and Robert Laurent. Works by Chaim Gross can be found in major museums and private collections throughout the United States, with substantial holdings (27 sculptures) at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden. A key work from this era, now at the Smithsonian American Art Museum, is the 1932 birds-eye maple Acrobatic Performers,  which is also only one and one quarter inch thick. His work was also part of the sculpture event in the art competition at the 1932 Summer Olympics.

Maturity 1933-1957
In 1933 Gross joined the government's PWAP (Public Works of Art Project), which transitioned into the WPA (Works Progress Administration), which Gross worked for later in the 1930s.  Under these programs Gross taught and demonstrated art, made sculptures that were placed in schools and public colleges, made work for Federal buildings including the Federal Trade Commission Building, and for the France Overseas and Finnish Buildings at the 1939 New York World's Fair. Gross was also recognized during these years with a silver medal at the Exposition universelle de 1937 in Paris, and in 1942, with a purchase prize at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's ""Artists for Victory"" exhibition for his wood sculpture of famed circus performer Lillian Leitzel.

In 1938 filmmaker and historian Lewis Jacobs made a 30-minute feature of Gross carving, called Tree Trunk to Head, showing Gross at work in his East Village studio on a portrait of his wife Renee, who models in the film.

In 1949 Gross sketched Chaim Weizmann, President of Israel, at several functions in New York City where Weizmann was speaking.  Gross began a portrait in clay and then traveled to Israel in the summer of that year hoping to be able to meet Weizmann and have him sit for a portrait.  Weizmann was too ill, but Gross completed the bust in bronze later that year.  Gross returned to Israel for three months in 1951 (the second of many trips there in the postwar years) to paint a series of 40 watercolors of life in various cities. This series was exhibited at the Jewish Museum (Manhattan) in 1953.  
 
Chaim Gross, Sculptor by Josef Vincent Lombardo, the first major book on Gross, came out in 1949. It included a catalogue raisonne of his sculpture.

In the 1950s Gross began to make more bronze sculptures alongside his wood and stone pieces, and in 1957 and 1959 he traveled to Rome to work with famed bronze foundries including the Nicci foundry.  At the end of the decade Gross was working primarily in bronze, which allowed him to create open forms, large-scale works and of course, multiple casts. Gross's large-scale bronze The Family, donated to New York City in 1991 in honor of Mayor Ed Koch, and installed at the Bleecker Street Park at 11th street, is now a fixture of Greenwich Village.

Later Career 1957-1991

In 1957, Gross published The Techniques of Wood Sculpture, an influential how-to book with photographs of him at work by famed photographer Eliot Elisofon. In 1959, a survey of Gross's sculpture in wood, stone, and bronze was featured in the exhibit Four American Expressionists curated by Lloyd Goodrich at the Whitney Museum of American Art, with work by Abraham Rattner, Doris Caesar, and Karl Knaths. In 1963, Gross and his family moved from their longtime residence at 30 W. 105th Street to Greenwich Village, following the purchase of a four-story historic townhouse and studio at 526 LaGuardia Place. The townhouse is now the Renee and Chaim Gross Foundation, winner of a 2015 Village Award from the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation, and open to the public.

In 1974, the Smithsonian American Art Museum held the exhibition, Chaim Gross: Sculpture and Drawings, organized by Janet A. Flint, Smithsonian Curator of Prints and Drawings. In 1976, a selection from Gross's important collection of historic African sculpture, formed since the late 1930s, was exhibited at the Worcester Art Museum in the show The Sculptor's Eye: The African Art Collection of Mr. and Mrs. Chaim Gross.

In 1977, Gross had three retrospective exhibitions: at the Lowe Art Museum at the University of Miami, followed by the Montclair Art Museum; and the Jewish Museum (Manhattan). The Jewish Museum's exhibition catalog featured an important essay on Gross by art historian and modern American sculpture specialist Roberta K. Tarbell, Professor Emeritus at Rutgers University.

Gross received multiple honorary doctorates in the 1970s and 80s: from Franklin and Marshall College (1970); Yeshiva University (1978); Adelphi University (1980); Hebrew Union College (1984); and Brooklyn College (1986). In 1979 Gross was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full Academician in 1981. In 1984, he was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Letters, with Jacob Lawrence and Lukas Foss. Gross died at Beth Israel Hospital in May 1991 and was buried at Mount Lebanon Cemetery in Queens, New York. In the fall of 1991, Allen Ginsberg gave an important tribute to Gross at the American Academy of Arts and Letters, which is published in their Proceedings. In 1994, Forum Gallery, which now represents the Chaim Gross estate, held a memorial exhibition featuring a sixty-year survey of Gross's work.

Teaching
Gross was a professor of printmaking and sculpture at both the Educational Alliance and the New School for Social Research in New York City, as well as at the Brooklyn Museum Art School, the MoMA art school, the Art Student's League and the New Art School (which Gross ran briefly with Alexander Dobkin, Raphael Soyer and Moses Soyer).

Gross was a member of the New York Artists Equity Association and the Federation of Modern Painters and Sculptors. He was a founder and served as the first president of the Sculptors Guild.

Personal life
In 1932 Gross married Renee Nechin (d. 2005), and they had two children, Yehuda and Mimi.  Mimi Gross is a New York-based artist. She was married to the artist Red Grooms from 1963-1976.

"We present an analysis of gravitational lensing by large-scale structure in the universe, as traced by neutral hydrogen (HI) at high redshifts z > 6. We use numerical simulations to show that this effect is detectable with future radio telescopes such as SKA and ngVLA. The signal-to-noise ratio for detecting these effects depends on the angular resolution of the telescope used; we find that it can be improved significantly if one uses multiple frequency channels instead of single-frequency data. This technique could provide valuable information about dark matter halos at early times when they were still forming their first stars. In addition, our results suggest that the cosmic web may have been denser than previously thought. Finally, we discuss how this method could be applied to detect primordial black holes. Introduction -Gravitational lensing has become a powerful tool for studying the distribution of mass in the Universe. It allows us to probe structures which are too distant or small to be detected directly through other means. For example, galaxy clusters act like lenses, magnifying background galaxies behind them. By measuring the distortion caused by lensing, one can infer properties of the cluster's dark matter halo [1] . Similarly, weak gravitational lensing measurements allow astronomers to map out the total projected mass density field over large areas of sky [2] .
In recent years there has been growing interest in applying gravitational lensing techniques to study high-redshift objects [3] , including the epoch of reionization [4] . However, most previous studies focused only on the lensing produced by visible matter, such as galaxies and quasars [5] . Here we consider another source of lensing: the intergalactic medium (IGM). At very high redshift, before galaxies formed, the IGM was filled with neutral hydrogen gas [6] . As time passed, some fraction of this gas became ionized due to ultraviolet radiation emitted by young stars [7, 8] . But even today, much of the IGM remains neutral [9] . Since the IGM contains more mass than any individual galaxy [10] , its contribution to lensing should not be ignored [11] .
The goal of this"	1
We present the results of our investigation into how stellar evolution models are affected by individual element abundances in stars, focusing on the sensitivity to changes in helium abundance (Y). We use two different sets of evolutionary tracks with varying Y values for masses between 0.8 M⊙ and 8 M⊙ at solar metallicity. The first set is based on the Padova code while the second one uses the Geneva code. For each track we calculate synthetic spectra using the SPECTRUM code. These synthetic spectra are then used as input to determine the best-fit parameters of observed high-resolution optical spectra of Galactic open clusters. Our analysis shows that both codes produce similar results when fitting these cluster data. However, there are significant differences in the derived ages depending on which code was used. This discrepancy can be explained by the fact that the Padova tracks have been calculated without convective overshooting whereas the Geneva tracks include this effect.	1
"**This is a long answer, which I think might be a little more satisfying than the others here to anyone who's interested in this question.**

I'm not a physicist, so take all this with a cup or two of of salt; but I'm not really satisfied with the answers so far, so I'll give my own try. The answers so far seem to get at some of the important points to your question, but don't tie things together in a very understandable way I think. So here goes. 

The first thing is to get some basic conceptual vocabulary down. The most important concept you'll need is the concept of a space-time manifold. Prior to Einstein, the world was used to thinking of space as this fixed three-dimensional grid that we move through. Think of a gigantic box that contains the whole universe. And we thought of time as a linear track that we were on, moving forward into the future, away from the past. So imagine this big box that contains the universe (space) now being set on a set of train tracks, and moving forward in a straight line, at a constant speed. 

On this picture, you can move around in space all you want, but it's just a bare fact about the universe that it's all moving forward in time at the same rate. *Why* you can't go back in time is sort of an unanswerable question. It's just a *basic fact* about the universe that everything's moving forward through time at a constant rate. You can't change that any more than you can change that matter takes up space, protons have positive charge, etc. And there's no more explanation for that fact than ""well, that's just the way things are.""

Enter Einstein. Einstein (and others, but we'll keep the story simple) suggests a very different picture of space and time. Rather than being two separate things - space being the 3d grid we move through, and time being a linear track we're going down - Einstein suggests that space and time are really a single, unified thing. 

Just as you can have a two dimensional space (a flat plane - a grid with only length and width, like a sheet of paper), you can add an extra dimension to it - height - to have a three-dimensional space with length, width, and depth. 

Einstein suggests that time is just a fourth spatial dimension that we add to the three-dimensional space we're used to thinking about. This is hard to picture in the way you picture a third dimension being added to a 2d space, but picturing it visually isn't very important so just stick with me. All you need to keep in mind is the *idea* that time is just like an extra spatial dimension. And, just as the addition of a third dimension to a flat plane creates the three-dimensional manifold we call real space; the addition of this fourth dimension to real space creates a four-dimensional manifold that we call space-time. 

So, we used to think of time as a track that everything moved down at a constant rate. We can now think of every object as being situated inside this 4D manifold called space-time. And, further, we can think of every object as having a constant speed that it's moving at. Why do objects move at a constant speed? That's an incredibly complex question of physics, and we'll leave it aside. Just take it as granted that we've discovered, empirically, that objects all seem to move at a constant rathe through this 4D manifold of space-time.

But, you don't *feel* like you're moving, right? You're probably sitting still. And you can *control* the speed at which you move too. You can run, drive, walk, sit, etc. So how is it that you have a constant speed through space-time? 

Well, to understand this, [look at this image.] (_URL_0_)

Imagine that you're that dot, and that the forward (y) axis is time, and the horizontal (x) axis is space. You're moving at a constant speed through this space-time manifold, and there's nothing you can do about that. The speed is fixed. What you *can* change, however, is the *direction* you move through space-time. You can move more in the x direction or more in the y direction, though you'll stay at the same constant speed, no matter what you do. 

 This sounds funky, but the basic meaning is this. When you move through space, you are diverting some of your space-time speed away from movement in the forward (time) direction to movement in the horizontal (space) direction. So, imagine you're sitting, and then you get up to go to the kitchen. When you were sitting, all of your space-time momentum was moving you through time. You weren't moving through space at all. When you got up and walked to the kitchen though, you diverted some of the speed at which you were moving through time to your movement through space. You moved a bit more slowly forward in time, so that you could move through space. 

Now, if instead of walking slowly to the kitchen, you had *sprinted* to the kitchen, you would have diverted even more of your space-time speed into movement through space, and thus would have made even less progress forward through time during your trip to the kitchen than if you had walked. 

This illustrates the fact that the faster you move through space, the slower you move through time. And, conversely, the slower you move through space, the faster you move through time.

So now, remember that constant speed I said you (and everything else) were moving at through space-time? That constant speed that everything is moving at is just one of many 'constant' facts about the universe. Other constants are things like the mass of an electron, the charge of a proton, etc. These constants are basic facts about the universe that we've discovered. We're not sure *why* these facts are the way they are, but they seem like basic, unalterable facts about the universe. 

There's a name - or at least a symbol - for this constant speed we're all travelling through space-time. It's notated with *C*. But just how fast is this speed we're moving through space-time? Well, it's the speed of light. That's what *C* is. When you sit down, you're moving at the speed of light (186,000 miles per second) through space-time. And all of that motion is in the forward (time) direction. When you get up and get a coke, you divert a tiny, tiny bit of that speed (say, two miles an hour?) to movement through space. And when you sit back down, those 2mph are returned to movement through time. 

So, remembering that this speed at which we move through space-time is a *constant* fact of nature, much like the mass of an electron, we can ask your question anew: Why can't we travel through time? 

Well, the answer is now very complex. We obviously *can* move through time. We're doing it right now, at nearly the speed of light. And we can alter the speed at which we move through time by moving through space at different rates.

But your question is presumably whether we can know with confidence that we can't go backward or jump forward in time. It *seems* that we can't. The reason is that, just in the way we can't make electrons that have different masses than they naturally do, because the mass of an electron is a fixed, constant fact about the universe; neither can we make objects that move through space-time at any different rate than they naturally do, because the speed at which all objects move through space-time is fixed at *C*. *C* is a constant that we don't know how to manipulate (and are currently most tempted to think is not manipulable). 

What we can do, however, is divert more or less of our speed through space-time in the space direction. If we diverted half our speed through time to speed through space (by travelling at half the speed of light) we would move through time half as fast. If we diverted all of our speed through time into speed through space (by travelling at the speed of light), then we would cease to move through time at all. Time, for us, would 'stop'. But what this really means is that *we* would stop moving through *time*. 

So, I think you've asked a question whose answer will be unsatisfying in direct proportion to how short it is. The short answer is that we know we can't travel back or jump forward through time because it seems that the speed of light is constant. The long, more satisfying answer is contained in a thorough understanding of relativity theory. I've tried to give something a little better than the first, and far, far short of the second."	0
"  A method is given for solving an optimal H2 approximation problem for SISO
linear time-invariant stable systems. The method, based on constructive
algebra, guarantees that the global optimum is found; it does not involve any
gradient-based search, and hence avoids the usual problems of local minima. We
examine mostly the case when the model order is reduced by one, and when the
original system has distinct poles. This case exhibits special structure which
allows us to provide a complete solution. The problem is converted into linear
algebra by exhibiting a finite-dimensional basis for a certain space, and can
then be solved by eigenvalue calculations, following the methods developed by
Stetter and Moeller. The use of Buchberger's algorithm is avoided by writing
the first-order optimality conditions in a special form, from which a Groebner
basis is immediately available. Compared with our previous work the method
presented here has much smaller time and memory requirements, and can therefore
be applied to systems of significantly higher McMillan degree. In addition,
some hypotheses which were required in the previous work have been removed.
Some examples are included.

"The authors introduce some new prior and approximate posterior families for variational autoencoders, which are compatible with the reparameterization trick, as well as being capable of expressing multiple modes. They also introduce a gating mechanism between prior and posterior. They show improvements on bag of words document modeling, and dialogue response generation. The original abstract is overly strong in its assertion that a unimodal latent prior p(z) cannot fit a multimodal marginal int_z p(x|z)p(x)dz with a DNN response model p(x|z) (""it cannot possibly capture more complex aspects of the data distribution"", ""critical restriction"", etc).

While the assertion that a unimodal latent prior is necessary to model multimodal observations is false, there are sensible motivations for the piecewise constant prior and posterior. For example, if we think of a VAE as a sort of regularized autoencoder where codes are constrained to ""fill up"" parts of the prior latent space, then there is a sphere-packing argument to be made that filling a Gaussian prior with Gaussian posteriors is a bad use of code space. Although the authors don't explore this much, a hypercube-based tiling of latent code space is a sensible idea.

As stated, I found the message of the paper to be quite sloppy with respect to the concept of ""multi-modality."" There are 3 types of multimodality at play here: multimodality in the observed marginal distribution p(x), which can be captured by any deep latent Gaussian model, multimodality in the prior p(z), which makes sense in some situations (e.g. a model of MNIST digits could have 10 prior modes corresponding to latent codes for each digit class), and multimodality in the posterior z for a given observation x_i, q(z_i|x_i). The final type of multimodality is harder to argue for, except in so far as it allows the expression of flexibly shaped distributions without highly separated modes. I believe flexible posterior approximations are important to enable fine-grained and efficient tiling of latent space, but I don't think these need to have multiple strong modes. I would be interested to see experiments demonstrating otherwise for real world data.

I think this paper should be more clear about the different types of multi-modality and which parts of their analysis demonstrate which ones. I also found it unsatisfactory that the piecewise variable analysis did not show different components of the multi-modal prior corresponding to different words, but rather just a separation between the Gaussian and the piecewise variables.

As I mention in my earlier questions, I found it surprising that the learned variance and mean for the Gaussian prior helps so dramatically with G-NVDM likelihood when the powerful networks transforming to and from latent space should make it scale-invariant. Explicitly separating out the contributions of a reimplemented base model, prior-posterior interpolation and the learned prior parameters would strengthen these experiments. Overall, the very strong improvements on the text modeling task over NVDM seem hard to understand, and I would like to see an ablation analysis of all the differences between that model and the proposed one.

The fact that adding more constant components helps for document modeling is interesting, and it would be nice to see more qualitative analysis of what the prior modes represent. I also would be surprised if posterior modes were highly separated, and if they were it would be interesting to explore if they corresponded to e.g. ambiguous word-senses.

The experiments on dialog modeling are mostly negative results, quantitatively. The observation that the the piecewise constant variables encode time-related words and the Gaussian variables encode sentiment is interesting, especially since it occurs in both sets of experiments. This is actually quite interesting, and I would be interested in seeing analysis of why this is the case. As above, I would like to see an analysis of the sorts of words that are encoded in the different prior modes and whether they correspond to e.g. groups of similar holidays or days.

In conclusion, I think the piecewise constant variational family is a good idea, although it is not well-motivated by the paper. The experimental results are very good for document modeling, but without ablation analysis against the baseline it is hard to see why they should be with such a small modification in G-NVDM. The fact that H-NVDM performs better is interesting, though. This paper should better motivate the need for different types of multi-modality, and demonstrate that those sorts of things are actually being captured by the model. As it is, the paper introduces an interesting variational family and shows that it performs better for some tasks, but the motivation and analysis is not clearly focused. To demonstrate that this is a broadly applicable family, it would also be good to do experiments on a more standard datasets like MNIST. Even without an absolute log-likelihood improvement, if the method yielded interpretable multiple modes this would be a valuable contribution."	0
"Pre WW2 most people slept on double beds and then manufacturers started trying to upsell  by selling them as ""for $1 more you can get an inch bigger bed"". As the WW2 economic boom was happening people started buying larger beds for their homes and the manufacturers were making advertisements comparing the old smaller beds to cribs, so naturally people bought into it because people are easy to manipulate. As time went on the now popular bigger beds were selling, the best sellers mostly fell into 3-4 size categories which we now know as twin, full, queen, king (matress height is not standardized in any way). They aren't truly standardized, these just sold the best. Beds also grew as average human heights have, naturally taller people need bigger beds. There are also oddball sizes like Cal Kings, Alaskan Kings, Wyoming Kings, Eastern, twin xl, full xl etc. I believe in Europe double beds are still somewhat standard. I worked in a big name matress factory for 5 years and the marketing and mark up is insane. I will never buy a mattress at  retail price and I suggest the same for others."	0
"  We consider binary mixtures of soft repulsive spherical particles and
calculate the depletion interaction between two big spheres mediated by the
fluid of small spheres, using different theoretical and simulation methods. The
validity of the theoretical approach, a virial expansion in terms of the
density of the small spheres, is checked against simulation results. Attention
is given to the approach toward the hard-sphere limit, and to the effect of
density and temperature on the strength of the depletion potential. Our results
indicate, surprisingly, that even a modest degree of softness in the pair
potential governing the direct interactions between the particles may lead to a
significantly more attractive total effective potential for the big spheres
than in the hard-sphere case. This might lead to significant differences in
phase behavior, structure and dynamics of a binary mixture of soft repulsive
spheres. In particular, a perturbative scheme is applied to predict the phase
diagram of an effective system of big spheres interacting via depletion forces
for a size ratio of small and big spheres of 0.2; this diagram includes the
usual fluid-solid transition but, in the soft-sphere case, the metastable
fluid-fluid transition, which is probably absent in hard-sphere mixtures, is
close to being stable with respect to direct fluid-solid coexistence. From
these results the interesting possibility arises that, for sufficiently soft
repulsive particles, this phase transition could become stable. Possible
implications for the phase behavior of real colloidal dispersions are
discussed.

This article presents an interesting idea that can be used to develop new statistical methods.  It also provides some useful insights into how these methods work.   However,  there seems to be no discussion about possible applications  beyond those mentioned here.    Also,   it would help if more details were provided regarding the experiments conducted   throughout the manuscript. For example,    - How many times was each experiment repeated?    - What type(s)  of datasets did they use?  - Which algorithms/parameters were compared?    - What other information could provide context when discussing results? Overall, I think it's worth publishing but perhaps after minor revisions. This research has potential impact because it proposes a new way to perform twosample testing using machine learning techniques which may lead to better understanding between different types of distributions	1
"The authors present an algorithm for learning to perform inference in graphical models from data that is generated according to some unknown distribution.
They show how this can be used as part of a larger framework where one learns both structure (i.e., which variables are connected) and parameters simultaneously.  The main idea behind their approach is to use gradient descent on the log-likelihood function with respect to all possible structures at once.   This has several advantages over previous approaches such as:  it does not require any assumptions about independence between different parts of the graph;   it allows us to jointly optimize over many more candidate graphs than would otherwise be practical;   ...

"The inter-hourly-variability index is proposed to measure geomagnetic activity on hourly basis, which can be used as an indicator for solar wind speed variation over time scales longer than one day.  The IHV index was calculated using hourly values of Kp index during the period 1957-2009. It shows that there are two peaks at about 1965-1970 and 1990-1995 . A linear regression analysis between the IHV index and solar wind speed data obtained by spacecraft observations reveals that they have good correlation with each other. This suggests that the IHV index may provide useful information for long-term prediction of solar wind speed. Keywords: Geomagnetism; Solar wind; Variability index; Prediction modeling; Data mining. 1 Introduction Space weather has been attracting more attention recently because it affects many aspects of human life such as satellite communications, aviation safety, power grids etc. (e.g., [1] ). In particular, solar wind plays important roles in space weather since it carries away magnetic fluxes generated by the Sun's dynamo action [2] , and thus controls the Earth's magnetosphere [3] .
Solar wind is driven out from the Sun by coronal mass ejections [4] . Coronal mass ejections occur when huge amounts of plasma suddenly escape from the Sun into space [5] . They usually last several hours [6] . Therefore, solar wind speed varies significantly within 24 h [7, 8] . However, most previous studies only focus on the average solar wind speed or daily averaged solar wind speed [9] . As a result, little work has been done on investigating how solar wind speed changes on shorter timescales [10] ."	1
"  Ad-hoc networks, a promising trend in wireless technology, fail to work
properly in a global setting. In most cases, self-organization and cost-free
local communication cannot compensate the need for being connected, gathering
urgent information just-in-time. Equipping mobile devices additionally with GSM
or UMTS adapters in order to communicate with arbitrary remote devices or even
a fixed network infrastructure provides an opportunity. Devices that operate as
intermediate nodes between the ad-hoc network and a reliable backbone network
are potential injection points. They allow disseminating received information
within the local neighborhood. The effectiveness of different devices to serve
as injection point differs substantially. For practical reasons the
determination of injection points should be done locally, within the ad-hoc
network partitions. We analyze different localized algorithms using at most
2-hop neighboring information. Results show that devices selected this way
spread information more efficiently through the ad-hoc network. Our results can
also be applied in order to support the election process for clusterheads in
the field of clustering mechanisms.

"The problem with these kinds of questions is that the top answers usually are what most people think sounds like the right answer. We know about the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and fight or flight, so if we see an answer with these terms, it sounds right and is upvoted. The actual answer is probably quite different.

I don't think that the top posters of this thread actually understand how the autonomic response work. The ANS is for acute stress only!  Cortisone and other long-term stress hormone is responsible for long-term stress response. When you are stressed, you don't feel the ""fight or flight"" high, you feel depressed because stress hormones (cortisol et al.)

Anyway, I don't think we will get the right answer in this thread, because the ENS (enteric nervous system) is not very well understood. Hopefully an expert will swoop and and educate us on the effect of serotonin deficiency in the ENS as a response to stress hormones.

Edit: For further details on the puppeteers of cortisol, please see CRH and ACTH. Its scope is beyond a 5 year olds. I love reading ELI5 because they educate me. Except when it's a medical thing, then I realize that if the top answer is ELI5, then the result could be a 5 year old's understanding.

BTW, if fight or flight is the cause of all your ills then the logical solution is to take an adrenergic blocker like propranolol or clonidine. Unfortunately these don't work for chronic stress. They are great for performance anxiety though!"	0
"An interesting connection is made between dropout, Tishby et al's ""information bottleneck"" and VAEs. Specifically, classification of 'y' from 'x' is split in two faces: an inference model z ~ q(z|x), a prior p(z), and a classifier y ~ p(y|z). By optimizing the objective E_{(x,y)~data} [ E_{z~q(z|x)}[log p(x|y)] + lambda * KL(q(z|x)||p(z))], with lambda <= 1, an information bottleneck 'z' is formed, where lambda controls an upper bound on the number of bits traveling through 'z'.

The objective is equivalent to a VAE objective with downweighted KL(posterior|prior), an encoder that takes as input 'x', and a decoder that only predicts 'x'.

- Related work (section 2) is discussed sufficiently. 
- In section 3, would be better to remind us the definition of mutual information.
- Connection to VAEs in section 5 is interesting.
- Unfortunately, the MNIST/CIFAR-10 results are not great. Since the method is potentially more flexible than other forms of dropout, this is slightly disappointing.
- It's unclear why the CIFAR-10 results seem to be substantially worse than the results originally reported for that architecture.
- It's unclear which version of 'beta' was used in figure 3a.

Overall I think the theory presented in the paper is promising. However, the paper lacks sufficiently convincing experimental results, and I encourage the authors to do further experiments that prove significant improvements, at least on CIFAR-10, perhaps on larger problems."	0
"Karl Sigmund Stromberg is a fictional character and the main antagonist in the 1977 James Bond film The Spy Who Loved Me. Stromberg was portrayed by Curd Jürgens. The character Stromberg was created specifically for the film by writer Christopher Wood. Ian Fleming's novel The Spy Who Loved Me was not told from Bond's perspective, but, rather, a Bond girl who is in love with him. The entire plot of the film has actually nothing to do at all with the plot of the novel. This was at Fleming's request; when he sold the rights to his novel to Eon Productions he requested only the title be used.

Biography

The webbed-fingered Karl Stromberg is a successful self-employed businessman as head of his own shipping firm and chain of laboratories. Stromberg's obsession and passion is the ocean where he lives in his palace, named Atlantis, that could submerge itself underwater so as not to be seen or detected. Located off the coast of Sardinia, Italy, Atlantis has everything to support life above and below water for any length of time. In fact, Atlantis is more like a city, able to support dozens if not hundreds of people. Stromberg also owns a huge tanker, named Liparus, that serves as his headquarters away from Atlantis. Aboard the tanker he has a small army of red soldiers. In Christopher Wood's novelisation of the film, Stromberg is Swedish and his first name is ""Sigmund"".

Scheme
Although Stromberg has a passion for the ocean and its various species, he despises the human race, not unlike Jules Verne's Captain Nemo. Stromberg, however, is much more diabolical and has no interest in benefiting the world. He has a congenital condition in which his hands are webbed like those of aquatic birds or mammals. It is his personal mission to start over with a new civilisation underwater via complete anarchy against the ""surface world"". After contracting two scientists to create the technology to track nuclear submarines, Stromberg uses this technology to capture a Soviet nuclear submarine and a British submarine. By tracking the subs, Stromberg's specially adapted tanker, Liparus, sneaks up on the subs, forces them to the surface through methods using some kind of high frequencies to disrupt the sub's electrical system and captures them inside the tanker. His plan calls for the firing of nuclear missiles from these subs at Moscow and New York City, thus framing each other's government and starting a nuclear war, which would wipe out every last human being on Earth. Among Stromberg's many minions were an assistant who betrayed him by trying to sell the plans for the submarine tracking system, and a professor and a doctor who were to help him operate the tracking system after it was complete. He killed his assistant by feeding her to a shark, and killed the professor and the doctor, having outlived their usefulness, by blowing up their helicopter. (In a comic relief after cancelling the payment to the professor and doctor he has his secretary inform the two men's families that they have met with an accident and are ""buried at sea"".)

This scheme is similar to that of an earlier Bond film, You Only Live Twice, which posited stealing space capsules to start a war between the Soviets and the Americans. The idea of commandeering two nuclear missiles and attempting to fire them at two major cities likewise recalls the plot of Thunderball. The scheme in which the villain wishes to destroy mankind to create a new race or new civilisation was also used in Moonraker, the next film after The Spy Who Loved Me. In Moonraker, the villain Hugo Drax has an obsession with restarting human civilisation in outer space, although Drax's plans were to eventually return to Earth, unlike Stromberg. The film Moonraker was also written by Christopher Wood. Both Stromberg and Drax have hired Jaws as a henchman.

Prevention
Stromberg's scheme is foiled after Bond is taken aboard the Liparus as a prisoner from a recently captured American submarine. With Bond's help, the crews from the submarines escape and take over the tanker. With the tanker under their control, Bond is able to order the stolen submarines, which were crewed by Stromberg's men, to fire their nuclear warheads at each other. Prior to this, however, Stromberg had abducted Bond's partner, the Russian agent Anya Amasova, and escaped to his city-ship, Atlantis.

Bond pursues Stromberg, and after two failed attempts by Stromberg to kill him (including the use of an explosive harpoon which ran the length of a dinner table), Bond exercises his licence to kill by shooting Stromberg multiple times in the groin and chest. Atlantis is later torpedoed and sunk, giving Stromberg a burial at sea.

Henchmen
 Jaws - survived
 Naomi - blown up by Bond
 Sandor - thrown off the edge of a building by Bond
 Liparus Captain - fatally wounded by an explosion
 Professor Markowitz - blown up in helicopter explosion
 Dr. Bechmann - blown up in helicopter explosion

"This is a dataset paper that brings unique values over existing reading comprehension challenges. Unlike others, MS MARCO is derived from query logs, thus represents real questions that people ask, rather than solicited questions that might be rather artificial in practical settings.

There are potential downsides of using query logs however. It may be that people adapt their language and questions for search engines such that users ask questions that they know current search engines can reasonably answer. Thus, it may be that people limit the complexity of questions or language or both. I think authors could have addressed this concern by being more selective about the query logs, by down-sampling on simple questions that can be easily answered by keyword matching without any sophisticated reading comprehension, and up-sampling more complex questions that require at least paraphrasing and ideally synthesis of information taken from more than one sentences.

It’s great that there are several new efforts to construct large-scale reading comprehension challenges, but my main concern is whether the majority of the questions can be answered through relatively easy text matching without intelligent reading or reasoning.

Also, the paper reads like the authors were running out of time before the deadline. I would appreciate more analytic and quantitative comparisons against other existing datasets, and more insights on the degree of challenges required to handle QAs in MS MARCO. For example, the authors could collect statistics on QAs: (1) exact match exists in the text snippet, (2) paraphrasing is required but otherwise the relevant answer is directly available in the text snippet, (3) requires synthesizing information taken from more than one sentences, (4) requires external knowledge. The author response mentions that (4) is unlikely, but a more formal and complete analysis would be helpful.

"The blue iguana (Cyclura lewisi), also known as the Grand Cayman ground iguana, Grand Cayman blue iguana or Cayman Island rock iguana, is an endangered species of lizard which is endemic to the island of Grand Cayman. It was previously considered to be a subspecies of the Cuban iguana, Cyclura nubila, but in a 2004 article Frederic J. Burton reclassified it as a separate species because according to him the genetic differences discovered four years earlier between the different C. nubila populations warranted this interpretation. The blue iguana is one of the longest-living species of lizard (possibly up to 69 years).

The preferred habitat for the blue iguana is rocky, sunlit, open areas in dry forests or near the shore, as the females must dig holes in the sand to lay eggs in June and July. A possible second clutch is laid in September. The blue iguana's herbivorous diet includes plants, fruits, and flowers. Its color is tan to gray with a bluish cast that is more pronounced during the breeding season and more so in males. It is large and heavy-bodied with a dorsal crest of short spines running from the base of the neck to the end of the tail.

The iguana was possibly abundant before European colonization; but fewer than 15 animals remained in the wild by 2003, and this wild population was predicted to become extinct within the first decade of the 21st century. The species' decline is mainly being driven by predation by cats and dogs, and indirectly by reduction in suitable habitat as fruit farms are converted to pasture for cattle grazing. Since 2004, hundreds of captive-bred animals have been released into a preserve on Grand Cayman run by a partnership headed by the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, in an attempt to save the species. At least five non-profit organizations are working with the government of the Cayman Islands to ensure the survival of the blue iguana.

Taxonomy
Its specific name lewisi commemorates the name of the scientist who collected the holotype of this species, Charles Bernard Lewis.

The closest relatives are the Cuban iguana (Cyclura nubila) and the Northern Bahamian rock iguana (C. cychlura). It can be genetically distinguished from the subspecies found on Little Cayman and Cayman Brac known as C. nubila caymanensis, although it can interbreed with this subspecies and produce fertile offspring.

In 1938 Lewis of the Institute of Jamaica joined an Oxford University biological expedition to the Cayman Islands. Lewis obtained two blue iguanas, a male and a female, which were later lodged with the Natural History Museum, London. Chapman Grant, in an article published in 1940, formally described the blue iguana as an separate taxon for the first time, classifying it as the trinomial C. macleayi lewisi. Albert Schwartz and Richard Thomas reclassified it as C. nubila lewisi in 1975, making it a subspecies of the Cuban iguana. In his 2004 article Frederick Burton repeatedly states Schwartz and Carey reclassified it in a 1977 publication, but he is mistaken.

Burton, who runs the captive breeding program on the island, reclassified the blue iguana as a distinct species in 2004. Although it has almost identical head scale counts and patterns as C. nubila, most individuals of this taxon often have five auricular spines in as opposed to four in caymanensis, although this is not diagnostic, and individuals of the nominate subspecies shows either morphologies in similar proportions. Also most lewisi have an extra pair scales behind the prefrontals, although not always and individuals from the other populations may also have these. Thus Burton concluded that using scale characteristics these three taxa could not be told apart in a consistent manner. According to him most important difference between the lewisi population and the other two is skin color. Although skin color is a variable characteristic that is usually considered unsatisfactory in taxonomy, Burton thought that in this instance it might be appropriate. Although all three taxa hatch with the same color, as they grow older lewisi becomes more uniformly bluish, whereas the other taxa can be more variable in coloration, although Burton states that this characteristic is not reliable in many circumstances, such as rainy weather. Other reasons Burton gave for recognising lewisi as a separate species were geography, there is at least 108 kilometres separating the forms, which Burton then interpreted to mean that the populations were reproductively isolated, despite there being no reproductive barriers between the populations. Grant reported seeing caymanensis on Grand Cayman in 1940, but Burton states that this was likely a mistaken sighting made during rainy weather. Lastly Burton points to mitochondrial DNA analysis performed by Catherine Malone et al. in 2000; although the sample size was extremely small and there was some ambiguity, the different populations did have different haplotypes. Although Malone et al. found C. nubila sensu lato to be monophyletic, Burton claimed lewisi could be separated from the other two taxa without rendering C. nubila polyphyletic. Although none of this might be used to traditionally delineate a population as a species, he proposed using the ""general lineage concept"" introduced by de Queiroz in 1998 to do so anyway.

Common names
This animal was originally called the Grand Cayman rock iguana, or Grand Cayman blue rock iguana. After separating this population taxonomically from the other Cayman Islands rock iguanas, Burton proposed a set of new vernacular names for the population in 2004: Grand Cayman blue iguana, Cayman blue iguana or for local colloquial use he proposed the simple abbreviated blue iguana.

Note that the name ""blue iguana"" is also used for bright blue forms of the green iguana, Iguana iguana.

Description
The blue iguana is the largest native land animal on Grand Cayman with a total nose-to-tail length of  and weighing as much as . This is among the largest species of lizard in the Western Hemisphere. The largest of the Cyclura, its body length is  with a tail equal in length. The blue iguana's toes are articulated to be efficient in digging and climbing trees. The mature male's skin color ranges from dark grey to turquoise blue, whereas the female is more olive green to pale blue. Young animals tend to be uniformly dark brown or green with faint darker banding. When they first emerge from the nest the neonates have an intricate pattern of eight dark dorsal chevrons from the crest of their necks to their pelvic area. These markings fade by the time the animal is one year old, changing to mottled gray and cream and eventually giving way to blue as adults. The adult blue iguana is typically dark gray matching the karst rock of its landscape. The animal changes its color to blue when it is in the presence of other iguanas to signal and establish territory. The blue color is more pronounced in males of the species. Their distinctive black feet stand in contrast to their lighter overall body color. The blue iguana's eyes have a golden iris and red sclera.

Blue iguanas are sexually dimorphic; males are larger and have more prominent dorsal crests as well as larger femoral pores on their thighs, which are used to release pheromones. The male is larger than the female by one third of his body size.

Distribution
The blue iguana is endemic to the island of Grand Cayman. As of 2012 the population can be found throughout the island Grand Cayman excluding the urban areas of Bodden Town, Gun Bay, Seven Mile Beach and West Bay. One theory for how the taxon ended up on the island is that a single female Cuban iguana, C. nubila nubila, with eggs inside her drifted across the sea, perhaps during a storm. Sometimes the Lesser Caymans iguana, C. nubila caymanensis, has been found on Grand Cayman.

Ecology

Habitat
 
The blue iguana is found only on the island of Grand Cayman. Comparison with other Cyclura species in the region strongly suggests that there was once a coastal population of blue iguanas which was gradually displaced or extirpated by human settlements and the construction of roads. The blue iguana now only occurs inland in natural xerophytic shrubland and along the interfaces between farm clearings, roads, and gardens and closed-canopy dry forest or shrubland. The interior population is believed to have been attracted to agricultural clearings and fruit farms which provide thermoregulatory opportunities, herbaceous browse, fallen fruit, and nesting soil, but this brought the blue iguana into contact with humans and feral animals. Females often migrate to coastal areas to nest. Blue iguanas released into the Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park on Grand Cayman were radiotracked in 2004 to determine ranges for each animal. Females were found to occupy territories of  and males an average of  with overlap in common territories, indicating that they choose to maintain a population density of four to five animals per hectare.

The blue iguanas occupy rock holes and tree cavities, and as adults are primarily terrestrial. Although not known to be arboreal, it has been observed climbing trees  and higher. Younger individuals tend to be more arboreal.

Diet
Like all Cyclura species, the blue iguana is primarily herbivorous, consuming leaves, flowers, and fruits from over 45 species of plant. The diet is very rarely supplemented with insects, crabs, slugs and fungi.

Predators
Hatchlings are preyed upon by the native snake Alsophis cantherigerus. The adults have no natural predators.

Longevity
Longevity in the wild is unknown but is presumed to be many decades. A blue iguana named ""Godzilla"" captured on Grand Cayman in 1950 by naturalist Ira Thompson was imported to the United States in 1985 by Ramon Noegel and sold to reptile importer and breeder, Tom Crutchfield in 1990. Crutchfield donated Godzilla to the Gladys Porter Zoo in Brownsville, Texas in 1997 and the lizard remained there until its death in 2004. Thompson estimated Godzilla to be 15 years of age at the time of his capture. At an estimated 69 years of age (54 of which were spent in captivity), Godzilla may be the world's longest-living lizard for which there is reliable record. A closely related Lesser Caymans iguana (C. nubila caymanensis) has been documented as living 33 years in captivity.

Reproduction
Mating occurs from May through June. Copulation is preceded by numerous head-bobs on the part of the male, who then circles around behind the female and grasps the nape of her neck. He then attempts to restrain the female in order to manoeuvre his tail under hers to position himself for intromission (copulation). Copulation generally lasts from 30 to 90 seconds, and a pair is rarely observed mating more than once or twice a day. A clutch of anywhere from 1 to 21 eggs are usually laid in June or July depending on the size and age of the female, in nests excavated in pockets of earth exposed to the sun. Several exploratory nests are begun before one is completed. These burrows can range from  to over  in length, with an enlarged chamber at its terminal portion to allow the female to turn around. The temperature within nests that have been monitored by researchers remained a constant  throughout the incubation period which ranges from 65 to 90 days. The blue iguana's eggs are among the largest laid by any lizard.

Individuals are aggressively territorial from the age of about three months onward. They typically reach sexual maturity after four years of age in captivity.

Conservation

Endangered status

The blue iguana is listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List. In 1988 the British researcher Roger Avery spent two weeks on the island and only observed three animals. Surveys in 2003 indicated a total population in the range of 5–15 individuals. In 2006 the iguana was one of the most endangered lizards on Earth.

Restored free-roaming subpopulations in the Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park and the Salina Reserve numbered approximately 125 individuals in total after an initial release in December 2005. The restored subpopulation in the Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park has been breeding since 2001, and the subpopulation in the Salina Reserve was deemed to be breeding in 2006 after a nest of three hatched eggs was discovered in the wild. In April 2007, after another large-scale release, there were 299 blue iguanas living in the wild, with hundreds more being raised in captivity on Grand Cayman. In late 2012, the blue iguana recovery program estimated that the wild population had risen to approximately 750 individuals, and the IUCN subsequently downlisted the species from critically endangered to endangered.

International trade in the species is regulated due to its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.

Causes of decline

Habitat destruction is the main factor threatening extinction for this iguana. Land clearance within remnant habitat is occurring for agriculture, road construction, and real estate development and speculation. The conversion of traditional crop lands to cattle pasture is eliminating secondary blue iguana habitat.

Predation and injury to hatchlings by rats, to hatchlings and sub-adults by feral cats, and killing of adults by pet dogs are all placing severe pressure on the remaining wild population. Automobiles and motorscooters are an increasing cause of mortality as the iguanas rarely survive the collisions. Trapping and shooting is a comparatively minor concern, and has stopped according to the IUCN in 2012, but before 1995 occasional trapping may have occurred.

The common green iguana, (Iguana iguana), has been introduced from Honduras and is well-established on Grand Cayman as an invasive species. It far outnumbers the native blue iguana. No direct negative consequences on the blue iguana due to this introduction are known, but the mere presence of the green iguana confuses public attitudes and understanding. For example, the people of the island are told that blue iguanas are endangered and rare, but the green iguana looks very similar and are quite common in suburban areas.

In 2008 six blue iguanas were found dead in the preserve within Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park on Grand Cayman. The iguanas were apparently killed by human vandals armed with knives and two of the slaughtered animals were gravid females about to lay eggs.

The wild population of blue iguanas had been reduced from a near island-wide distribution to a non-viable, fragmented remnant. By 2001 no young hatched in the unmanaged wild population were surviving to breeding age, meaning the population was functionally extinct, with only five animals remaining in the wild.

Recovery efforts
In 1990, the American Zoo and Aquarium Association designated the genus Cyclura as their highest priority for conservation. Their first project was an in situ captive breeding program for the blue iguana.

One of the early difficulties encountered was that the captive stock of the early 1990s was found not to be pure. It was discovered through DNA analysis that the captive population contained a number of animals that were hybrids with C. nubila caymanensis. These hybrids were sterilized by means of hemipenectomies so that the program contain only pure-breeds. This program was created to determine the exact genealogies of the limited gene pool of the remaining animals and DNA analysis revealed that the entire North American captive population was descended from a single pair of animals.

As a hedge against disaster striking the blue iguana population on Grand Cayman, in 2004 an ex situ captive population was established in 25 zoos in the USA. A minimum of 20 founder lines represented by at least 225 individuals is being maintained by captive breeding and recorded in a studbook for the species by Tandora Grant of the San Diego Zoo's Center for Conservation and Research for Endangered Species. By 2002 the Indianapolis Zoo had success with breeding the blue iguana in captivity twice since the year 2000.

In October 2006, hatchlings were released into the wild for the first time to boost the species and help bring them back from the brink of extinction. Each released blue iguana wears a string of colored beads through its nuchal crest for visual identification at a distance, backed up by an implanted microchip and a high-resolution photograph of its head scales. Head scale patterns are as unique among blue iguanas as fingerprints are among humans.

The blue iguana is established in captivity, both in public and private collections. There are very few pure-bred animals in private collections, animals in captive breeding programs are often hybrids with the Lesser Caymans Iguana (C. nubila caymanensis) and occasional hybrids with the Cuban Iguana (C. nubila nubila). Breeding in the pet trade minimizes the demand for wild-caught specimens.

Blue Iguana Recovery Programme

The Blue Iguana Recovery Programme grew from a small project started in 1990 within the National Trust for the Cayman Islands. It is now a partnership, linking the Trust with the Cayman Islands Department of Environment, National Trust Cayman Islands, Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park, Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, International Reptile Conservation Foundation, IRCF, and the European Commission. This program operates under a special exemption from provisions in the Animals Law of the Cayman Islands, which normally would make it illegal for anyone to kill, capture, or keep iguanas. BIRP's conservation strategy involves generating large numbers of genetically diverse hatchlings, headstarting them for two years so that their chance of survival in the wild is high, and using these animals to rebuild a series of wild sub-populations in protected, managed natural areas. A rapid numerical increase from a maximum possible number of founding stock is sought to minimize loss of genetic diversity caused by a population bottleneck.

Restored sub-populations are present in two non-contiguous areas —the Salina Reserve and the Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park. Habitat protection is still vital, as the Salina Reserve has only  of dry shrubland, which is not enough to sustain the 1,000 blue iguanas that were planned to be restored to the wild. The 2001 plan called for additional sub-populations to be restored in one or more other areas. When the wild sub-populations have reached the carrying capacity of their respective protected areas, release of head-started animals will be phased out.

The overall captive population is likely to remain genetically fragmented in the long term. To maintain gene flow, individuals should be translocated between zoos.

According to the 2001 plan, breeding of blue iguanas in the wild will require indefinite future management. To sustain this activity, a range of commercial activities was hoped to generate the required funding. An education and awareness effort in 2007 was meant to ensure local involvement and support.

In April 2019, one iguana laid 18 eggs for possible hatching. Any survivals will be the first successful breeding since 2015. In 2018, seven eggs were laid but none hatched.

"  Several interesting astrophysical phenomena are symmetric with respect to the
rotation axis, like the head-on collision of compact bodies, the collapse

gravitational waves. Most current numerical relativity codes, however, can not
take advantage of these symmetries due to the fact that singularities in the
adapted coordinates, either at the origin or at the axis of symmetry, rapidly
cause the simulation to crash. Because of this regularity problem it has become
common practice to use full-blown Cartesian three-dimensional codes to simulate
axi-symmetric systems. In this work we follow a recent idea idea of Rinne and

several examples clearly showing the regularity of our evolutions.

"We introduce the concept of chain motifs, which are subgraphs that occur frequently in real-world networks but rarely or never in random graphs with similar degree distributions. We show how to use these motifs as building blocks for generating synthetic networks whose properties closely match those of their natural counterparts. Finally, we demonstrate how this approach can be used to study the evolution of biological networks by comparing two versions of the same metabolic pathway taken from different species. In recent years there has been an explosion in interest in studying large collections of interacting entities known as complex networks. These include social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn; information networks like the World Wide Web (WWW); communication networks such as phone calls; transportation networks including roadways and railways; and many others. A common feature shared among all of these systems is that they consist of nodes connected together via links. For example, in a social network each node represents an individual user while edges represent friendships between users. Similarly, in a WWW graph web pages correspond to nodes and hyperlinks connect them. Despite the diversity of applications, most studies have focused on characterizing global topological features of these networks using statistical measures such as average path length, clustering coefficient, assortativity coefficients, etc., see e.g. 
 
 However, it turns out that even though these statistics provide useful insights into large-scale structural patterns observed across diverse classes of networks, they fail to capture important local structures present within specific types of networks. This motivates us to develop new techniques capable of identifying small-scale patterns that may not be captured by traditional approaches. Herein lies one of our main contributions - we propose a novel class of subgraphs called chain motifs that occur frequently in real world networks but rarely or never appear in randomly generated graphs with similar degree distribution. Using these motifs as building blocks, we construct synthetic networks whose properties closely resemble those of their natural counterparts.

"This paper proposes SEM, a simple large-size multilabel learning algorithm which models the probability of each label as softmax(sigmoid(W^T X) + b), so a one-layer hidden network. This in and of itself is not novel, nor is the idea of optimizing this by adagrad. Though it's weird that the paper explicitly derives the gradient and suggests doing alternating adagrad steps instead of the more standard adagrad steps; it's unclear whether this matters at all for performance. The main trick responsible for increasing the efficiency of this model is the candidate label sampling, which is done in a relatively standard way by sampling labels proportionally to their frequency in the dataset.

Given that neither the model nor the training strategy is novel, it's surprising that the results are better than the state-of-the-art in quality and efficiency (though non-asymptotic efficiency claims are always questionable since implementation effort trades off fairly well against performance). I feel like this paper doesn't quite meet the bar."	0

There is currently no cure available for this deadly disease; however, it does not spread through human contact so people should feel safe visiting sick horses.

There isn't much known yet about exactly how EIA gets into horses but scientists believe that flies play a role.  Flies feed off other insects such as mosquitoes; mosquitos then bite horses carrying the EIA virus which causes them to become ill.

" It typically begins with sudden, severe pain — often in one joint, and most commonly in your big toe (on one side or the other). It often begins at night, and may wake you from sleep. The affected joint often appears red and swollen and may feel warm to the touch, and you will likely have a decreased range of motion around the affected joint.


If your joint pain is of gradual onset and does not match the profile above, it is less likely to be gout.
It may be something else, such as rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis, among other things.;
, An infection may also occur concurrently alongside a gout attack, and the two are almost impossible to tell apart without diagnostic tests.


An infected joint will likely also be sudden in onset, appear red and swollen and warm to the touch, and may be accompanied by a fever.
You will need analysis of your joint fluid to distinguish between gout and an infection.

,""Pseudogout, also known as calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD), also presents very similarly to gout (hence its name). Again, the only way to truly differentiate pseudogout from gout is to have your joint fluid looked at under a microscope.

, If you do have gout, you will experience ""attacks"" of it followed by remissions (or followed by total resolution). Gout does not tend to be a persistent, chronic, and consistent condition. Rather, it either comes as a one-time attack, or a series of flare-ups and exacerbations, followed by periods of remission (or improvement).


If the pain in your joint persists for weeks or even months, without much variability, it is likely to be another diagnosis such as rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis.

,


If your family members have had gout before, you are also at a heightened risk of developing gout. This, again, would increase the probability that your current joint problem is gout-related.
Additional risk factors for gout include: being male, being a post-menopausal female, having other health conditions (namely high blood pressure, diabetes, or kidney problems), consuming excess alcohol, being overweight, and taking certain medications (such as aspirin, diuretics, and certain immunosuppressive agents).

, Chronic gout consists of recurrent gout attacks over a prolonged period of time. It often leads to the formation of ""tophi"" (hard bumps under the skin in the joint area), which is a characteristic sign of chronic gout.


The presence of tophi — that can be visually seen in a joint — is one of the cardinal signs of chronic gout (also known as ""tophaceous gout"").
This is one of the best ways to distinguish gout from other chronic arthritic conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, because no other chronic forms of arthritis present with tophi.

, The medical conditions to consider in the differential diagnosis will depend significantly on whether you have only one joint affected, or multiple joints affected. The differences are as follows:


If you have only one joint affected, it is more likely to be gout, pseudogout, or an infected joint.
If you have multiple joints affected, it may still be gout or pseudogout. It may also be another condition, though, such as rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis.
Lastly, if you have multiple joints affected, the probability of an infection is slim to none (as an infection normally affects only one joint at a time).

, Elevated uric acid levels heighten the likelihood that it is gout. Creatinine is a measure of kidney function. Poor kidney function may lead to inadequate uric acid clearance from your body, and the resulting build-up of uric acid may predispose you to gout.


Note, however, that there is no direct correlation between uric acid levels on your blood test and a diagnosis of gout.
Many people have elevated uric acid levels, but do not ever experience clinical signs or symptoms of gout.
Similarly, many people who do have clinical signs and symptoms of gout do not who elevated levels of uric acid.
There is a correlation, for sure, and your likelihood of gout is increased with elevated uric acid levels, but it is not required (nor is it the exclusive criteria) in the diagnosis of gout.

, She will then examine this fluid under the microscope.


If it is gout, the microscope will show the presence of uric acid crystals.
It is is pseudogout, the microscope will show the presence of calcium pyrophosphate crystals.
If it is septic arthritis, the microscope will show neither uric acid crystals nor calcium pyrophosphate crystals.

,

Although looking at synovial joint fluid under a microscope can be diagnostic of gout (if the presence of uric acid crystals is detected), it is key to understand that gout and an infection are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Therefore, even if the test comes back diagnostic for gout, an infection could still potentially be present.

Having the synovial fluid sent for a culture will examine to see if any bacteria or other microbes grow.
If there is an infection, the culture dish will grow the microbe, which will be diagnostic for ""septic arthritis"" (a diagnosis that may exist alongside gout).

,

An x-ray can help to distinguish between gout and other arthritic conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, which has a distinct appearance on x-ray. An x-ray is usually sufficient for imaging; however, in some cases, an ultrasound or a CT scan may also be of help in assessing your underlying joint problem, particularly if it does not appear to be caused by gout., Examples include Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and Naproxen (Aleve). These can be purchased over-the-counter at your local pharmacy or drugstore.


Stronger NSAIDs may be prescribed to you by your doctor if the over-the-counter versions are insufficient to help relieve your gout.

,


As a result, colchicine is most frequently used after an acute gout attack subsides, with the goal of preventing future gout attacks.
Taken in low doses for preventative purposes, the side effects of colchicine are rarely problematic.

, Corticosteroids can be prescribed in pill form, or they can be injected directly into the affected joint (which is usually the better option, as you avoid the side effects that can come from taking them in pill form).


An example of a corticosteroid is Prednisone.
Corticosteroids are generally given in limited amounts, such as one (or minimal) injections into your affected joint, and/or a limited course of corticosteroids taken in pill form.

, The purpose of these medications is to decrease your likelihood of future gout attacks.


Allopurinol is an example of a medication that can help to prevent excess uric acid production.
Probenecid is an example of a medication that can aid in your kidney's ability to filter and remove uric acid from your body.

"Isagani A. Cruz (October 11, 1924  – March 21, 2013) was a Filipino judge who served as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines from 1986 to 1994. He retired from the Supreme Court on October 11, 1994, due to the court's mandatory retirement age of 70 years.

Personal life

Cruz was originally from Manila. He graduated from Manuel L. Quezon School of Law in 1951. He placed eighth in the 1951 Philippine Bar Examination with a score of 90.12%. He married his wife, Salvacion, on May 3, 1952.

Prior to his appointment to the High Court, Justice Cruz served, among others, as Chair of the Code Commission of the Department of Justice (1966-1972); Senior Partner, Laurel Law Offices; and  Dean, College of Law, Lyceum of the Philippines University (1963-1968). He was also a full professor and/or bar reviewer in Political Law, Constitutional Law and International Law in the University of the East, San Beda College, Ateneo de Manila University, University of Santo Tomas, San Sebastian College, Adamson University, and University of Manila (1975-1986).

He wrote a column called ""Separate Opinion"" for the Philippine Daily Inquirer from 1995 to 2010 after retiring from the Supreme Court.

Isagani A. Cruz died in his sleep on March 21, 2013, at the age of 88. He was survived by his wife of 60 years, Salvacion, and six children -  Cesar, Claro, Celso, Carlo, Isagani Jr., and Cynthia.

Notable opinions 
 Javier v. Comelec (1986) – ""where the Court effectively ruled in favor of Evelio Javier, a rival of Marcos’ KBL party member Arturo Pacificador, in the Batasan polls in May 1984 in Antique. In 1986, Javier was killed in an ambush during the pendency of the case.""
 People v. Carmina (1991) the high court held ""Even if treachery were not present in this case, the crime would still be murder because of the dismemberment of the dead body. One of the qualifying circumstances of murder under Article 248, par. 6, of the Revised Penal Code is ""outraging or scoffing at (the) person or corpse"" of the victim."" (joined by Justices Narvasa, Gancayco, Griño-Aquino and Medialdea)''

"Multiple reasons, some have already been mentioned in to comments, others haven't. Keep in mind that this is based on my experience working with this in Sweden. Mileage in other countries may vary. 

1. Horses are less noisy and more approachable. People can come up and talk to the officer in a different way. 

2. The horse still offers mobility and speed. 

3. Tradition and culture. In a lot of places, like Sweden (where I live) horses are fairly integrated in culture. People enjoy seeing horses out and about. Not everyone want to approach one, but that's fine. 

4. Crowd control. You absolutely do not fuck with one of those horses. They're huge, and on their back you have a trained police officer. It's a force multiplier. I've seen sports events riot like situations where three mounted officers replaced 20-25 officers in riot gear. The fights stopped immediately and people scattered. 

5. Accessibility. A mounted officer can move in areas where a car can technically move, but is advised not to because it could cause blockage or congestion. Such as walking streets or shop streets. 

6. Visibility. A police forces primary task is to maintain law and order. This is preferably done by preemptive measure, with things as simple as visible presence being at the top of efficiency. A mounted officer can both see and be seen easier. This has a calming effect on the public as well as encourages approaching the officer. We were often approached about very minor things, which didn't warrant any kind of report or anything, but that keeps the public happy and calm to be able to let the authorities know about."	0

" Assertive communication carries respect for the feelings, needs, wants, and opinions of others. An assertive communicator avoids infringing upon the rights of others, while asserting their own, seeking compromise in the process. Assertive communication utilizes actions and words to express boundaries of needs and wants in a calm fashion, while conveying a message of confidence., The verbal cues that indicate assertive communication convey respect, sincerity and firmness. These cues might include:Firm, relaxed voice
Fluent and sincere
Appropriate volume for situation
Cooperative and constructive

, Just like verbal cues, non-verbal communication conveys assertive behavior and can indicate respect, sincerity and confidence. Non-verbal features might include:Receptive listening
Direct eye contact
Open body stance
Smiling when pleased
Frowning when angry

, An assertive person will naturally gravitate towards certain thought patterns that indicate their confidence and respect for others. These thoughts might include:“I won’t be taken advantage of, or attack another person.”
“I will stand up for myself in a respectful manner.”
“I will express myself directly and openly.”

, Assertiveness can often be incorrectly confused with aggression. Aggressiveness lacks respect for others. It is a complete disregard for the needs, feelings, wants, opinions, and sometimes even the personal safety of other people. Aggressive communication can often be identified by angry and/or demanding behavior, self-promotion, and manipulation.


Verbal features of aggressive communication might include: sarcastic or condescending remarks, blaming, shouting, threats, boasting, or the use of put-downs.
Nonverbal features of aggressive communication might include: intruding upon others’ personal space; fist-clenching, crossed arms, scowling, or staring down another person.
Thoughts associated with aggressive communication might include: “I feel powerful, and will get others to do my bidding,"" ""I am in control of other people,"" or ""I refuse to be vulnerable.”

, Silence and assumption are the hallmarks of the passive communication style. Passive communicators often lack of respect for themselves, disregarding their own opinions, feelings, needs, and desires. Passive communication places one’s own needs and desires below those of others. Passivity takes away one’s power and allows others to decide the outcomes of situations.:


Verbal features of passive communication might include: hesitancy, quiet, self-dismissal, or self put-downs.
Non-verbal features of passive communication might include: averting the gaze or looking down, slouched posture, crossed arms, or covering the mouth with hand.
Thoughts associated with passive communication might include: “I don’t count,"" or “People will think poorly of me.”

, From early childhood, our behaviors are adapted to fit responses received from our environment, families, peers, coworkers, and authority figures. Communication styles, such as passiveness, assertiveness, and aggression, can be extensions of cultural, generational, and situational influences. Assertiveness is much more valued in Western societies.


Older generations may find it more difficult to act assertively. Men were once taught that emotional expression was a sign of weakness, while women were taught that stating their own needs and opinions conveyed messages of aggression. Sometimes, it can even be difficult for us to discern which behaviors are appropriate to use in different situations., It is important not to blame yourself if you do not understand how to communicate assertively. Other types of communication styles, such as passiveness and aggression, can be parts of a vicious cycle. You can break this cycle by learning new assertive ways of thinking and behaving.If your family taught you to place the needs of others before yourself as a child, it may be difficult for you to assert yourself.
If your family or peer group handled conflict by yelling and arguing, you may have learned to deal with conflict accordingly.
If your social group believed that negative emotions should be concealed, or if your have ever been ignored or ridiculed for expressing these types of feelings, then you may have learned not to communicate negative emotions.

, In order to learn how to communicate assertively, it is important that you learn how to effectively manage your emotions. For some, just gaining insight into their own emotional processes can be enough to help them change the way they communicate with others and enable them to express their emotions in a more assertive manner. Keeping a journal can be the best to get to the bottom of your behavior, by recording situations and asking specific questions that relate to assertiveness., Write down situations that trigger your emotions. Stick to facts and try not to make any interpretations in this first step. For example, you may simply write, “I asked my friend to go out to eat, and she said ‘no’.”

, Be honest about how you felt. Specify what emotions you were aware of at the time, and rate the intensity of each emotion on a scale from 0 to 100 (not intense at all to extremely intense). Just give an estimate but be honest with yourself.

, Note any physical symptoms you may have felt at the time. Ask yourself, “What did I do?” and “What did I feel in my body?”


For example, if someone ignored your phone call, maybe you felt sick to your stomach or tension in your shoulders.

, These thoughts may be assumptions, interpretations, beliefs, values, and so forth. Ask yourself, “What was I thinking?” or “What was going through my head?” For instance, you may write down: “I agreed to go out to eat when she asked me, so she should have said yes when I asked her,” or “Saying no was rude of her,” or “Maybe she doesn’t want to be my friend anymore.”

, Again using the 0 to 100 scale, rate the strength of your thoughts in the situation. Record a “0” if you didn’t believe the thought, or a “100” if you believed it 100%. Then ask yourself, “Am I thinking in a passive, assertive, or aggressive manner?” Record your response to this question. Record any evidence for, or against, each thought. Evaluate whether there may be other ways to interpret the situation.

, In order to find a more balanced and assertive manner of thinking and behaving, ask yourself, “What would be a more assertive way of thinking or responding?”

, After you have evaluated the situation, revisit the intensity of your original emotions and the strength of your beliefs in the situation. Rate them again from 0 to 100.

, Through the journaling exercise, you are likely to decrease the intensity of your emotions. Evaluate your emotions, thoughts, and reactions during different types of situations. If you continue to practice, you may begin to think and behave in a more assertive manner.

, Assertiveness is a learned style of communication that allows for the confident expression of one’s needs and feelings while, at the same time, remaining mindful of the opinions, wants, needs, and feelings of others. It is an alternative to behaving in a passive or aggressive manner. There are many benefits to learning how to communicating assertively:Strong and effective communication
Confidence
Self-esteem enhancement
Gain respect of others
Improves decision-making skills
Reduces stress of not having needs met
Enables conflict resolution
Self-respect increases
Feelings of being ignored or coerced replaced by feelings of being understood and in control of decisions
Tendency to be less depressedDecreased likelihood of substance abuse, Saying no can be difficult for many people. However, saying “yes” when you need to say “no” can lead to unnecessary stress, resentment, and anger toward others. When saying no, it can be helpful to keep in mind a useful set of guidelines:Keep it brief.
Be clear.
Be honest.
For example, if you don't have time to do a favor that you don't have time to do, you can simply say, ""I can't this time. Sorry to disappoint you, but I have too many things to do that day, and there's no room in my schedule.""

, When you are speaking with someone, remain calm and have respect for them. This will enable the other person to heed what you say and treat you with respect too.


It may help to breathe deeply if you start to feel upset. Doing so will initiate your body's calming process and help you stay in control.

, Communication may seem like a simple task, however, much of what we attempt to communicate to others – and what is communicated to us – can often be misunderstood. This may cause frustration or conflict in our relationships with other people. When communicating with someone, state your feelings, wants, opinions, and needs in simple sentences. This will help the other person clearly understand what you’re asking.For example, instead of speaking to a family member in long sentences full of hints and indirect statements, you can be brief and direct: ""I love when you call me just to talk! It's hard for me to have a long conversation during work hours, though. I'd appreciate it if you called during the evening instead.""

, “I” statements convey that you are willing to take responsibility for your own thoughts and behaviors. There are different types of “I” statements that are appropriate for a variety of situations:Basic assertion: This type of “I” statement can be used in everyday situations to make your needs known, or to give praise, information, or facts. Basic assertions can also be utilized in self-disclosure situations to ease anxiety and enable relaxation. It includes: “I need to leave by 6 o’clock,” or “I enjoyed your presentation.”

Empathetic assertion: This particular “I” statement contains elements of recognition of another person’s feelings, needs, or desires, as well as a statement of your own needs and desires. It can be used to indicate your sensitivity to another person’s position, such as, “I know you are busy, but I need your assistance.”

Consequence assertion: This is the strongest form of “I” statement, often used as a last resort assertion. It can be misinterpreted as aggressive if you are not careful to observe your non-verbal behavior. The consequence assertion informs another person of the penalties for not changing their behavior; usually in situations when someone is not considering the rights of others. An example would be a work situation when procedures or guidelines are not being followed: “If this happens again, I am left with no choice but to pursue disciplinary action. I would prefer to avoid that.”

Discrepancy assertion: This type of “I” statement is used to point out a discrepancy between what has been previously agreed upon, and what is actually happening. It is used for clarifying misunderstandings and/or contradictions in behavior. You might say, “As I understand, we agreed that Project ABC was our number one priority. Now you are asking me to allow more time for Project XYZ. I would like you to clarify which is now the top priority.”

Negative feelings assertion: This form of “I” statement is utilized in situations where you feel negative feelings toward another person (anger, resentment, hurt). It enables you to convey these feelings without making an uncontrolled outburst, and alerts the other party of the effects of their actions. You might say, “When you procrastinate on your report, it involves my working over the weekend. I feel annoyed by this, so in the future I would like to receive it by Thursday afternoon.”

, Always remember when being assertive, your non-verbal communication is important. It is possible to think you are acting assertively when you are actually being passive or aggressive because you are not careful about your non-verbal communication style.


Keep your voice calm and volume neutral
Maintain good eye contact
Relax your face and body position

, Adopting assertive behavior takes time and practice so that it can become second nature to you. Practice having conversations in the mirror. Alternately, practice your conversation with your therapist or counselor.

, It can be challenging to keep your emotions under control, which can affect the way we communicate. When we get stressed or upset, our bodies go into stress mode, which puts our bodies into a chemical and hormonal reaction to get ready for a perceived threat.The way you think in this state is different than the way you would think with a calm, clear, rational mind and body, making it more difficult for you to use your assertiveness techniques.Acknowledge when you have stress in your life. Make a list of the things that are contributing to your stressful state.

, Relaxation techniques bring our bodies back to a balanced physiological state. For example, meditation has a calming effect on the brain that lasts well after your meditation session. This has a direct effect on the amygdala, the center in the brain responsible for emotional reasoning.Try to meditate every day for at least 5-10 minutes.Sit in a comfortable chair or on a pillow.
Close your eyes and focus on sensations that you’re having. Pay attention to what you feel with your body, what you hear, and what you smell.
Turn your attention to your breathing. Inhale for a count of four, hold your breath for a count of four, and exhale for a count of four.
Whenever your mind wanders, dismiss the thoughts without judgment and refocus your thinking on your breath.
You might add a mantra or metta, or a saying that uplifts you and gives you positive feelings, such as, “May I be peaceful,” or “May I be happy.”You might also try a guided meditation, which helps you visualize relaxing imagery., When you are in a stressful situation, deep breathing can help reduce stress and help you think clearly. Take some deep breaths by slowly and deliberately inhaling and exhaling.


Sit comfortably in a chair with your arms and legs uncrossed, feet flat on the floor, and hands resting on your thighs. Gently close your eyes.
Breathe in through your nose, observing the quality of the breath while inhaling and exhaling.
Slowly lengthen each inhalation by smoothly deepening each breath down into your abdomen. Pause briefly, then note the smooth, steady breath released as you exhale.
Begin counting the rhythm of your breaths. Inhale for 3 seconds. Exhale for 3 seconds. Maintain slow, even, and controlled breathing. Try not to speed up.
Use this rhythm while breathing for 10-15 minutes
When finished, gently open your eyes. Relax momentarily. Then, slowly rise from the chair.

, If you’re nervous about meditation or feel you don’t have the time to practice it faithfully, the relaxation response can still be activated through progressive muscle relaxation.This technique activates the body’s calming response and brings the body back into physiological balance by tensing and relaxing each muscle group in the body in progression. To practice progressive muscle relaxation in about 15-20 minutes per day:


Find a comfortable position in a chair with your feet flat on the floor, your hands resting on your thighs, and your eyes closed.
Start the exercise by clenching your fists, holding for 10 seconds. Then release, feeling the relaxation sensation for another 10 seconds. Repeat.
Tense your lower arm by bending your hand downward at the wrist, hold for 10 seconds. Release, and relax for another 10 seconds. Repeat.
Work through the rest of your body, pausing to tense and relax each muscle group. Start with your upper arms, shoulders, neck, head, and face. Then continue with your chest, stomach, back, buttocks, thighs, calves and feet.
When you’ve worked through your entire body, sit for a few minutes to enjoy the sensation of feeling relaxed.
Stand slowly to avoid dizziness (blood pressure drops when relaxed) or tensing up again unexpectedly.
If you don’t have 15-20 minutes to complete the entire exercise, you can practice on muscle groups that are noticeably tense.

, Making decisions is part of being assertive. You are taking control of your life and making decisions that best suit you, rather than letting someone else make decisions for you or allow yourself to become swayed by someone else against your better judgment. By identifying the problem, you will be able to address critical elements that result in good decision-making. Niagara Region Public Health recommends using the IDEAL model:I – Identify the problem.
D – Describe all possible solutions. These might include handling it yourself, asking for intervention from someone else, or doing nothing.
E - Evaluate the consequences of each solution. Evaluate your feelings and needs to determine the best outcome for yourself.
A - Act. Choose a solution and try it. Use “I” statements to express your feelings and needs.
L - Learn. Did the solution work? Evaluate why or why not. If it didn’t work, look at the other solutions on your list and work through them.

, There may be multiple parties who will be impacted by a decision, but not all of them necessarily have to be involved with the decision-making. Get input from those who need to be involved.You should consider the other parties as you make your decision, but the final say will come from you.

, All decisions are prompted by the need for some course of action. Take time to determine the purpose behind this course of action. This will ensure that the decision is the correct one.

, Procrastination can be a major impediment to assertive decision-making. Don’t leave the decision to the last minute or you may eliminate some of the possible solutions., Boundaries are the physical, emotional, and intellectual barriers that you create to protect yourself from harm. Healthy boundaries protect your personal space, self-esteem, and maintain your ability to separate your own feelings from those of others. Unhealthy boundaries increase your likelihood of exposure to being adversely affected by others feelings, beliefs, and behaviors., When you go into a conversation where you want to discuss your needs, it’s important to know your boundaries beforehand. Having your boundaries at the forefront of your mind before a conversation will keep you from getting derailed and compromising your needs in the middle of a conversation because it's easier or helps you avoid conflict.


For example, establish a boundary with your boss of not working on the weekends or not working overtime without three days’ notice. If you're talking to a friend, have a boundary of not picking her up at the airport again until she picks you up when you need a ride.

, If you do not feel right doing something, then don't do it. It's okay to reject someone. Remember, for yourself, the most important person is you. If you don't respect your own desires, how can you expect others to?


You may think that being a people-pleaser will put you on people’s good side, but unfortunately, an overabundance of generosity usually has the opposite effect on people.
People only value the things they invest time/energy/money into, so if you’re the one doing all the giving, your esteem for that person will skyrocket, but theirs for you will decline. Take a stand. People may resist at first – or even be shocked by your transformation – but in the end, they will respect you for it.

, Don't be silent if you have something to say. Share your feelings freely: it's your right. Remember, there's nothing wrong in having an opinion. Just make sure you pick the right moment to state your needs. Make it clear that what you have to say is important and should be noticed.


Practice in low-stakes situations. Do all your friends love that new TV show everyone’s talking about? Don’t be afraid to admit that you weren’t all that impressed. Has someone misinterpreted what you said? Don’t nod and play along; explain what you really meant, even if the miscommunication was harmless.

, Identify what makes you happy and what your needs are. This will help you develop a set of expectations for other people to follow in how you would like to be treated. Think of situations where you don’t feel like you’re being treated with mutual respect or situations where you felt like your feelings were not being considered. Then consider what could happen to make you feel more respected., Acting confidently won’t do you any good if you can never make up your mind or are trying too hard to “go with the flow.” People will be accommodating to your needs if you can tell them clearly what those needs are.


Off-loading decision-making onto everyone else is a passive-aggressive way of shirking your responsibility – and placing the consequences squarely on someone else’s shoulders. The next time your friends ask you where you want to go to dinner, don’t respond with, “Oh, wherever”; give them a concrete answer.

, A good approach is to adopt a “we” mentality and come up with solutions that will make both parties happy, if the situation allows. This way, everyone’s feelings are being considered and heard.For instance, if you drive your roommate to work every day, yet she doesn’t pay for gas, approach her about this issue. You can say, “I don’t mind giving you rides every so often. Owning a car is really expensive, though, and I am saving you money and time if you were to take the bus to work every day. Would you mind chipping in for gas every week? I’d really appreciate it.” In this way, you are acknowledging that she might not realize that you feel a certain way. Now she is aware of the problem without you using an accusing tone.

, Self-confidence is reflected by your ability to understand how you see yourself. This includes your self-perception and where you believe you fit in the social hierarchy. If you see yourself in a negative light, you might experience great difficulty asserting your own thoughts, beliefs, needs, and feelings. Furthermore, you may feel intimidated or reluctant to ask questions when you need clarification, focus too heavily on your own negative traits, and lack trust in yourself. Self-doubt prevents assertive communication. Assess your self-confidence through self-evaluation by asking yourself these questions:Can you maintain eye contact when communicating with others?
Do you project your voice properly?
Do you speak confidently (without using the phrases “uh” or “um” frequently)?
Is your physical posture or stance erect and open?
Do you have the ability to ask questions when clarification is needed?
Are you comfortable around other people?
Are you able to say no when appropriate?
Are you able to express anger and annoyance appropriately?
Do you offer your opinion when in disagreement with others?
Do you defend yourself against mistakes that are not your fault?
If you answered no to 3 or fewer of these questions, you are likely a self-assured individual. If you answered no to 4-6 of these questions, there is a significant chance that you see yourself negatively. If you answered no more to than 7 questions, you are likely to experience tremendous difficulty with self-confidence. You may often doubt your worthiness of respect or see yourself lower in the social hierarchy.

, The way you hold yourself speaks volumes about you – long before you even get a chance to open your mouth. Keep your shoulders squared and your chin up. Avoid fidgeting (put your hands in your pockets if you must) or covering your mouth when you speak. Look people in the eye when you speak to indicate that you don't intend to be brushed off.


Try not to be easy to read, especially if you are nervous or uncertain. Hide your “tells” by controlling your hands, feet, and facial expressions so that they don’t betray your emotions.
If making eye contact is a problem, practice with sunglasses and then work up to doing it barefaced. If you must avert your gaze, look off into the distance as if in thought, not down.
Even if you are nervous or confused, you can still act confident. There's no shame in asking questions.

, Rushing when you talk is an admission that you don’t expect people to take the time to listen. Speaking slowly, on the other hand, will indicate to people that you’re worth the wait. Use a clear, calm voice. You don't need to be loud, but you do need to make yourself heard.


If people aren't noticing you, say ""Excuse me"" clearly and firmly. Don’t be apologetic when you haven’t done anything wrong, as this can communicate to people that you feel slightly embarrassed just for existing.
Try to be concise when you speak. Even the most confident person in the world will lose their audience if they don’t make their point soon enough.
Avoid saying um or like as much as you can when you're trying to make a strong statement. Make a conscious effort to get these words out of your vocabulary.

, Shallow though it may be, people make snap judgments based on your appearance. People who are naturally confident and charismatic can change others’ minds, but the rest of us aren’t so lucky. If you're wearing clothes that look like you've just got out of bed, or if you wear a pound of make-up with fluffy high-heels, the average person won't take you seriously. On the other hand, if you look like you're ready to get things done, people will tend to be more respectful.


Dressing well doesn’t necessarily mean dressing up. If you’re the naturally casual sort, focus on having clean, matching, unwrinkled clothes with no embarrassing slogans or inappropriate images.
Making an effort to be serious about your appearance will make it look like you're more serious about your demands.

, This may sound silly, but if you want to project confidence, then you should sound firm and decisive when the moment comes. What better way to get there than to practice? You can practice in front of the mirror, into a recording, or even with a trusted friend, pretending he or she is your boss, significant other, or whomever you plan to speak with.


When the moment comes, remember how confident you sounded when you were just rehearsing, and work to sound even more confident when it counts.

, If you feel you still need help becoming assertive, it can help to see a professional. Counselors and psychologists have education and training specifically in helping people communicate in healthy and meaningful ways., Many universities offer assertiveness training to the students.This will help you practice assertiveness techniques while helping you discuss different situations where you feel you need help in being assertive, as well as help in controlling your stress as you navigate different situations.

, Asserting yourself takes practice and time. Ask a friend to help you practice your communication skills in various scenarios. The more you face situations that demand assertiveness, even when they are mock situations, the more confident you will become.

"  The name Schur is associated with many terms and concepts that are widely
used in a number of diverse fields of mathematics and engineering. This survey
article focuses on Schur's work in analysis. Here too, Schur's name is
commonplace: The Schur test and Schur-Hadamard multipliers (in the study of
estimates for Hermitian forms), Schur convexity, Schur complements, Schur's
results in summation theory for sequences (in particular, the fundamental
Kojima-Schur theorem), the Schur-Cohn test, the Schur algorithm, Schur
parameters and the Schur interpolation problem for functions that are
holomorphic and bounded by one in the unit disk. In this survey, we discuss all
of the above mentioned topics and then some, as well as some of the
generalizations that they inspired. There are nine sections of text, each of
which is devoted to a separate theme based on Schur's work. Each of these
sections has an independent bibliography. There is very little overlap. A tenth
section presents a list of the papers of Schur that focus on topics that are
commonly considered to be analysis. We begin with a review of Schur's less
familiar papers on the theory of commuting differential operators.

"The Andarta is the largest river in Romania's Carpathian Mountains, and one of its longest tributaries to the Târnava Mare (Great Tarn). It rises on the southern slopes of Mount Piatra Craiului at 1,530 metres above sea level near the village of Valea Viilor. The name means ""white water"" or ""snowy waters"" because it flows through snow-covered areas during winter months.
It has two main branches that join together about 10 kilometres from their source; these are called Bârsa Mică (Little River) and Bârsa Mare (Big River), respectively."	1
"When  the onion turns translucent, the cell walls are breaking down. But more  important to the difference in flavor between raw and cooked onions are  sulfur compounds floating in the cell fluid and sulfur-reacting enzymes  stored in vacuoles (basically closed storage compartments) inside the  cells.

When you cut or chew on a bit of  raw onion, these vacuoles are ruptured, and the enzymes inside react  with the sulfur in the cell fluid, creating strong, irritating compounds  (intended, of course, to discourage animals from eating the plant). In  particular, onions, shallots, and some related plants, when sliced,  produce a compound called 'lacrimator', which is both light and  volatile. It enters the air and first acts on the nerve endings in your  eyes, causing some direct pain, and then breaks down into tiny amounts  of sulfuric acid, both of which cause you to tear up in defense.

The  process of cooking onions denatures these enzymes, stopping the process  of converting the intracellular sulfur compounds into these defensive  compounds, which removes the harsh flavors, leaving just the sweet, sort  of meaty flavor that we all know and love.

Sweet  or Vidalia onions, which are grown in particularly low-sulfur soil,  don't have many of the sulfur precursors in their cells, which is why  they're so much less harsh when used raw.

You can read all about the process in Harold McGee's On Food and Cooking.

"Paper money, aka bills or notes, needs to be redesigned every so often. Most of the time, it's because doing so allows the Reserve to add new security features to fight against counterfeit, but sometimes, it's also to change the designs to be more aesthetically pleasing, or to add features that make it easier for the visually impaired to use (if all notes were the same size, how would a blind man know if he's getting the right change back?)

A while back, someone proposed removing Founding Father, and founder of the United State's national bank, from the $10, in order to put a woman onto a note for the first time. The proposal didn't sit well with fans of Mr. Hamilton, as nobody's more fitting to exist on american currency as he, especially when there are people like Jefferson or Jackson on other bills that would have been more fitting to remove, considering Jefferson was a slaver and misogynist that tried to dismantle Hamilton's national bank, and Jackson was an old corrupt, racist, anti-Semitic, misogynist, who removed Native Americans from their land, and also tried to dismantle the national bank.

In the end, they decided to remove Jackson (since people barely even see the $2 bill Jefferson is on) in order to add Harriet Tubman to the front of the widely-used $20. Harriet Tubman was a very important agent of the Underground Railroad, leading many former slaves to freedom in the north, as well as being the first woman to lead an army while freeing slaves at Combahee Ferry.

Harriet Tubman was selected to be on the $20, as she's done more good for more people in America than Jackson. Even Jackson's claim to fame, the Battle of New Orleans, wasn't even done by his own merit; he won due to British incompetence, and he frequently ignored orders, facing several court marshals."	0
"The authors propose to regularize convolutional neural networks (CNN) using locally constrained decorrelation layers.
They show that this approach improves performance on several datasets including CIFAR-10/100, SVHN, ImageNet-1K, Places205, and Tiny-ImageNet compared against state-of-the-art methods such as Dropout, BatchNorm, and WeightDecay. 
This is an interesting idea which could be further explored in future work.  The main strength of their method lies in its simplicity - it only requires adding one extra layer per network while still achieving good results across many different tasks without any hyperparameters tuning required from users' side.
However, there are some issues I would like them to address before publication. 

First, they should provide more details about how exactly LCD works for each dataset used here so readers can better understand why LCD performs well under certain circumstances but not others.   Second,  although the authors claim that ""LCD does not require any additional parameters""  when applied to existing models, it's unclear whether this statement holds true if we apply LCD directly onto pre-trained model weights instead of training from scratch.    Thirdly,   since the proposed method has been shown effective at improving generalization ability over multiple datasets, I'd expect the authors to also test out other popular architectures besides VGG-16/-19 and Resnet-50/-101."	1
"The authors propose a new method called SoftMax Probability (SMP) which uses probability values obtained during training as features to detect whether test data are correctly classified or not.  The proposed approach has been tested with three different datasets including MNIST handwritten digits dataset,  CIFAR-10 image classification dataset  and LibriSpeech audio book dataset.   In addition, they also compare SMP against other state-of-the-art methods such as Dropout Detection Method  (DDM), Deep Learning Classifier Output Shifting Technique (DCOST).   They found out that SMP performs better compared to DDM but worse when it comes to DCOST.    Overall, I think it's interesting work because there hasn't been much attention paid towards developing techniques to detect errors made by neural networks yet despite its importance especially since deep learning models are getting more complex day-by-day.

"Panmixia (or panmixis) means random mating. A panmictic population is one where all individuals are potential partners. This assumes that there are no mating restrictions, neither genetic nor behavioural, upon the population and that therefore all recombination is possible. The Wahlund effect assumes that the overall population is panmictic.

In genetics, random mating involves the mating of individuals regardless of any physical, genetic or social preference. In other words, the mating between two organisms is not influenced by any environmental, hereditary or social interaction. Hence, potential mates have an equal chance of being selected. Random mating is a factor assumed in the Hardy–Weinberg principle and is distinct from lack of natural selection: in viability selection for instance, selection occurs before mating.

Description
In simple terms, panmixia (or panmicticism) is the ability of individuals in a population to interbreed without restrictions; individuals are able to move about freely within their habitat, possibly over a range of hundreds to thousands of miles, and thus breed with other members of the population.

To signify the importance of this, imagine several different finite populations of the same species (for example: a grazing herbivore), isolated from each other by some physical characteristic of the environment (dense forest areas separating grazing lands). As time progresses, natural selection and genetic drift will slowly move each population toward genetic differentiation that would make each population genetically unique (that could eventually lead to speciation events or extirpation).

However, if the separating factor is removed before this happens (e.g. a road is cut through the forest), and the individuals are allowed to move about freely, the individual populations will still be able to interbreed. As the species's populations interbreed over time, they become more genetically uniform, functioning again as a single panmictic population.

In attempting to describe the mathematical properties of structured populations, Sewall Wright proposed a ""factor of Panmixia"" (P) to include in the equations describing the gene frequencies in a population, and accounting for a population's tendency towards panmixia, while a ""factor of Fixation"" (F) would account for a population's departure from the Hardy–Weinberg expectation, due to less than panmictic mating. In this formulation, the two quantities are complementary, i.e. P = 1 − F. From this factor of fixation, he later developed the F statistics.

In a panmictic species, all of the individuals of a single species are potential partners, and the species gives no mating restrictions throughout the population. Panmixia can also be referred to as random mating, referring to a population that randomly chooses their mate, rather than sorting between the adults of the population.

Panmixia allows for species to reach genetic diversity through gene flow more efficiently than monandry species. However, outside population factors, like drought and limited food sources, can affect the way any species will mate. When scientists examine species mating to understand their mating style, they look at factors like genetic markers, genetic differentiation, and gene pool.

Panmictic species 

A panmictic population of Monostroma latissimum, a marine green algae, shows sympatric speciation in southwest Japanese islands. Although panmictic, the population is diversifying. Dawson's Burrowing bee, Amegilla dawsoni, may be forced to aggregate in common mating areas due to uneven resource distribution in its harsh desert environment. Pantala flavescens should be considered as a global panmictic population.

Related experiments and species 

 Anguilla rostrate, or the American eel, exhibits panmixia throughout the entire species. This allows the eel to have phenotypic variation in their offspring and survive in a wide range of environmental conditions
 In 2016, BMC Evolutionary Biology conducted a study on Pachygrapsus marmoratus, the marbled crab, marking them as panmictic species. The study claimed that the crabs' mating behavior is characterized by genetic differentiation due to geographic breaks across its distribution range and not panmixia
 In a heterogeneous environment such as the forests of Oregon, United States, Douglas squirrels (Tamiasciurus douglasii) exhibit local patterns of adaptation. In a study conducted by Chaves (2014) a population along an entire transect was found to be panmictic. Traits observed in this study included skull shape, fur color, etc. 
 Swordfish based in the Indian Ocean (Xiphias gladius) have been found to be a single panmictic population. Markers used in the study carried out by Muths et al (2013) found large spatial and temporal homogeneity in genetic structure satisfactory in order to consider the swordfish a singular panmictic population.

"This is an explanation not just for this specific case but for large companies in general. These companies create jobs, and will also be paying taxes on a myriad of things. Sometimes the government will therefore sweeten the pot by reducing certain costs, knowing full well that overall they and the community will benefit from the implementation. This can end up being tax breaks, public utility rate break, favorable loans, etc. 

**There are often a lot of benefits of having a large company implemented in the region, and as such local or state governments will often try to create incentives for that to happen.**

**Edit:** -Just thought I should add a couple of things based on some of the replies I've been getting. I replied to the OP in very general terms about why businesses might be given incentives because I assumed that was what was happening in this case, without looking up the specific example of Nestle in BC. I've now taken five minutes to look things up. This cost is associated with the Water Sustainabilty Act coming into effect in 2016. The 2.25$ is the current maximum cost in the province, so Nestle are not getting any special favors.

I also want to mention that a lot of people have been talking about corruption etc. Honestly that's completely off topic. Yes in general corruption in the world does exist, but assuming that everyone and everything is corrupt just makes you sound like a conspiracy theorist in an RV with a tin foil hat (that sounds like it's straight out of a game of clue)."	0
"  We model a sheared disordered solid using the theory of Shear Transformation
Zones (STZs). In this mean-field continuum model the density of zones is
governed by an effective temperature that approaches a steady state value as
energy is dissipated. We compare the STZ model to simulations by Shi, et
al.(Phys. Rev. Lett. 98 185505 2007), finding that the model generates
solutions that fit the data,exhibit strain localization, and capture important
features of the localization process. We show that perturbations to the
effective temperature grow due to an instability in the transient dynamics, but
unstable systems do not always develop shear bands. Nonlinear energy
dissipation processes interact with perturbation growth to determine whether a
material exhibits strain localization. By estimating the effects of these
interactions, we derive a criterion that determines which materials exhibit
shear bands based on the initial conditions alone. We also show that the shear
band width is not set by an inherent diffusion length scale but instead by a
dynamical scale that depends on the imposed strain rate.

"No one knows, but it is used in many places around the world to celebrate victories and achievements of athletes or teams. It was invented by an American football coach at Notre Dame University during halftime of their game against Georgia Tech on December 31st, 1931.  The original cheer was ""Go Irish! Go Yellow Jacket!""  No one knows who created this chant except that he did not come up with it himself; rather his assistant coaches helped him create it as they were trying out different chants before the big matchup between these two schools. Yes. This phrase originated from America Football Coach Knute Rockne's team song called ""The Fighting Irish March"" which has been played since 1930s.

"I can't speak for the others, but most Chinese keyboards work using the pinyin system (_URL_0_), which is a transliteration of the sounds of the language (so that it can be written in the letters of the English alphabet). Basically, you download a font package that puts a little icon on your task bar to switch between writing in English and writing in Chinese. When you have the Chinese font selected, you just type in a pinyin word using English characters, like ""ma."" 


The thing is, Chinese is a tonal language. That means you can say ""ma"" in many different ways and it means different things. There are five tones in Mandarin (high flat, rising, dipping down then up, sharp drop, and neutral). Just like with English, sometimes even the same sound means a different thing (e.g., ""plane,"" ""plain""). So for ""ma,"" there are something like 80 possible words for the sound. You can type in just the English letters (""ma"") or maybe the English letters plus the tone (""ma4,"" sharp drop in tone). When you type that in, a bunch of characters will appear just above your cursor and you can use the arrow keys or your mouse to select the right one. Usually, the characters appear in order of how common they are, so it doesn't take too long to find the right one.


There's also keyboards that have character strokes, different types of lines that are used to compose a Chinese character. Because these strokes are used in a very specific order when writing any Chinese character, you could also use that keyboard by typing the strokes in the right order. I've never used that sort of keyboard, though."	0
"The Hungarian Revolution of 1848 was the first successful revolution in Europe against absolutist rule, and it inspired many other European countries to follow suit.
In Hungary itself there were several unsuccessful attempts at reforming the monarchy before the outbreak of war on 23 March 1848 when King Ferdinand I dismissed Prime Minister István Széchenyi who had been trying to introduce reforms into government administration as well as social welfare measures such as free primary education (which he introduced) and land redistribution among peasants.  The king's decision caused widespread outrage throughout the country which led to riots across Budapest where crowds attacked police stations and burned down houses belonging to members of parliament.   On 24 April 1848, the National Assembly declared independence from Austria-Hungary after Emperor Ferdinand refused to accept their demands that included the restoration of Széchenyi as prime minister.    In response, Austrian forces occupied Buda-Pest while Russian troops crossed the border near Világos.

"Alexandru Al. Ioan Cuza (also known as Alexandru A. Cuza, A. A. Cuza, or Sașa Cuza; 1862 or 1864 – April 4, 1890) was a Romanian aristocrat and politician. He was the eldest of the sons adopted by Domnitor Alexandru Ioan Cuza and his consort, Elena Rosetti-Cuza. Public opinion and historians generally agree that both Cuza brothers were Cuza's natural sons from his mistress Maria Catargi-Obrenović, though another hypothesis has them as born to Maria from her liaison with Cezar Librecht, the Postmaster General and spy chief. His biological and his adoptive mother both belonged to the boyar aristocracy of Moldavia. Through Catargi, Alexandru and Dimitrie were half-brothers of Milan I Obrenović, the King of Serbia, and of General Radu Catargi. During his brief political activity, Alexandru was repeatedly described as a Russophile or more specifically an agent of the Russian Empire, resembling in this Maria and her father, Costin Catargi.

Alexandru Ioan's reigned marked the first political union between the two Danubian Principalities (Moldavia and Wallachia), which was to form the Kingdom of Romania in 1881. In the 1860s, his father made a conscious attempt at establishing a Cuza dynasty—this, together with his dissolute lifestyle, helped coalesce the ""monstrous coalition"", which fought to have him deposed. When Alexandru Ioan was ousted and replaced with Carol of Hohenzollern (February 1866), Alexandru Al. Ioan followed him into exile, graduating from the University of Paris. He settled back in Romania after his father's death, attempting to create a current of opinion against Carol, and being presented, by his partisans and adversaries alike, as a competitor for the throne. He rallied with the opposition Conservatives for the election of January 1888, winning a Third-College seat in the Assembly of Deputies, whereupon he resigned. In mid 1888, he helped journalists Alexandru Beldiman and Grigore Ventura found an anti-Carlist newspaper, Adevărul.

Alexandru stepped back from politics shortly after the peasant riots of 1888, having been identified as their inspiration, and possibly co-instigator. Also that year, when Dimitrie Cuza died, he was the last surviving direct male heir of the Cuzas, and the sole landowner of Ruginoasa. Gravely ill and allegedly incapable of fathering children of his own, he disinherited his adoptive mother, while favoring his young wife, Maria Moruzi. After his death in Madrid, the Cuza estate, including Ruginoasa manor, passed through his widow onto the Moruzis and the Brătianus. The dying out of the Cuza line remained contested into the 20th century, with inaccurate reports that ""Cuza's son"" was leading the peasants' revolt of March 1907, and with new claimants appearing in both France and Chile.

Biography

Adoption scandal
According to most accounts, Sașa Cuza and his younger brother Dimitrie were born from a liaison between the Domnitor and his mistress Maria, the Moldavian boyaress, previously married into the House of Obrenović. Their maternal grandfather was Costin Catargi(u), a great landowner and Moldavian separatist, who had opposed Cuza's arrival to the throne in 1859. Through Maria, the two Cuza boys were also half-brothers of Milan, the future Serbian King, who was Maria's eldest son. On the Catargi side, their uncle Alexandru and cousin Alexis were noted career diplomats, while another uncle, George, was Domnitor Cuza's aide-de-camp. 

Through Alexandru Ioan, Sașa descended from a matrimonial alliance of Moldavian boyars and Phanariotes. His paternal grandmother, Sultana Cozadini, was the niece of Moldavian Prince Nicholas Mavrogenes. The Cozadini family was an Italo–Greek branch of the Bolognese Gozzadinis—who had owned parts of Kea under the Duchy of the Archipelago, afterwards merging into the Phanariote community of Istanbul. Memoirist and social historian Radu Rosetti, who was also a relative of Cuza's wife Elena ""Doamna"", claims that there was no actual blood connection between Alexandru Ioan and his purported sons. He believes that their actual father was Maria's other lover—Cezar Librecht, the Belgian-born Postmaster General of Romania. By 1864, Librecht was running a quasi-legal secret service, which ran political errands for Cuza Sr.

Domnitor Cuza's legal marriage, meanwhile, produced no heirs. He and Elena were virtually separated by 1866, and, sources attest, were at best friendly to each other. Maria Obrenović was allegedly a Russophile, like her father, and rumors spread that, as part of this political intrigue, she intended to have Cuza divorce her rival. Instead, the boys were successively adopted by Elena: Alexandru on  (that is, shortly after the Domnitor had effected a coup, deposing his critics in Parliament), Dimitrie on November 17/5, 1865. As noted by scholar Mihaela Mudure, ""Elena never complained about her husband's filandering, nor about her inability to birth a child, who would have consolidated her marital relationship with Alexandru Ioan Cuza. [...] She records the appearance of two children, born to her husband's mistress, as a normal ocurrence. In the adoption papers, they are mentioned as 'bereft of parents'"". Both boys were baptized Romanian Orthodox, having as their godfathers the Domnitors associates, Librecht and Iordache Lambrino.

Their acceptance into the family came just as Cuza's authoritarian reign descended into administrative chaos, and as the monarch himself was calming his nervous states with alcohol and womanizing. The adoption act was especially alarming for the growing camp of anti-Cuzists, many of whom were dedicated supporters of rule by a foreign prince. As noted by scholar Frederick Kellogg: ""On some Romanian palates, Cuza's amorous affair smacked of a scheme to establish a native dynasty with bastards as heirs to the crown."" Among those who suggest that Cuza intended to make Sașa his successor is researcher Alexandru Lapedatu, who also concluded that, at the time, Cuza was overreaching, isolated, ""surrounded and adored by his favorites"". According to historian Barbara Jelavich, while some in Cuza's party did look to Maria Obrenović's sons as the natural successors to the throne, ""there was so much opposition to the idea of a native prince, as well as to Cuza himself, that this alternative had little chance of success."" She continues: ""By 1865 Cuza had won a formidable array of opponents on both the right and left.""

Gender historian Nicoleta Roman uses the Cuza family as a study case of illegitimacy and adultery in the two principalities. She notes that the adoption was probably accepted by Elena after her husband's pressures. This is also reported by military historian Constantin Chiper, according to whom Elena Cuza was at first ""revolted"" by the monarch's requests, and remained ""profoundly depressed"" by his affair. The truth concerning Sașa's birth was a matter of public record, and a subject of great irritation for Elena's clan, the Rosettis. According to Roman: ""Contemporaries knew about [the liaison] and did not refrain from condemning the great prince's immoral behavior, nor from turning the subject into a scandal where the mother was the main culprit."" Nevertheless, both Alexandru and Dimitrie were still being introduced as orphans. In one such version of events, they were presented as Bucharest children, rescued from the 1864 flood. Cuza remained adamant that the boys had ""no known parents""—this definition is preserved in his testament of January 1873, whereby Elena and the two male heirs are each granted a third of the Cuza family estate. The document nominated Metropolitan-Primate Calinic Miclescu and Efrem Ghermani as, respectively, caretaker of the estate and tutor of the Cuza boys.

With Elena's acquiescence, Maria had been by Alexandru Ioan's side during much of his career, and was found with him when, in February 1866, a ""monstrous coalition"" conspiracy deposed and exiled Cuza. During Cuza's arrest, the conspirators separated Cuza and Maria from Elena, who was left with the two boys. Seen as especially dangerous, Librecht was imprisoned by the 1st Chasseurs Battalion. He was subject to several quick trials over charges of embezzlement, and, though eventually aquitted, was asked to leave the country. In parallel, the deposed monarch was also pressured into exile. Elena decided to join him, even as the Rosettis (some of whom had participated in the coup), asked her to sue for a divorce. The Cuzas moved periodically, from Austria-Hungary to the Kingdom of Italy, then to the German Empire, at Heidelberg. Although Cuza was no longer welcome in Romania, his wife and the two boys made occasional returns to their domain at Ruginoasa. Maria Obrenović followed the Cuzas into exile, accompanied by her nephew Efrem Ghermani. In Vienna, she gave birth to another son, Radu. Purportedly fathered by a Russian officer (Konstantinovich), he was given the family name Catargi, and grew up to become a Romanian Land Forces general.

Claimant
Later in 1866, Romanian representatives had selected Carol I as the Domnitor, and had agreed to a dynastic rule under his House of Hohenzollern. Alexandru Ioan died in May 1873 at Heidelberg, leaving his last will to be contested by a collateral Cuza line. Elena, Alexandru and Dimitrie moved to France, sharing their house with the Domnitors former secretary, Frenchman Arthur Baligot de Beyne. In August of that year, French Prime Minister Albert de Broglie reported to his ambassadors that Carol was meeting the opposition of ""extreme parties"", and that ""hostile newspapers have no shame in publicly advancing as a candidate one of Cuza's sons, for whom a Regency seems to have been already created."" In 1875, a Bondrea Cuza and a Mrs. Figa opened a legal case against the adoption at the Suceava County court, and implied that they were going to expose Sașa and Dimitrie's true parentage; in the end, the plaintiffs failed to attend the procedures, and the case was annulled. Maria Obrenović spent her final years as a lady-in-waiting for Empress Augusta. In 1876, having been diagnosed with cancer, she committed suicide aged 41. Her belongings were left to Milan, Maria's legitimate son, who renounced all claims to them in 1879. During those years, her Obrenović son (married to the Romanian Natalia Keșco) had taken power in the Principality of Serbia, replacing his assassinated uncle Mihailo III; Milan himself ultimately abdicated in 1889.

During that interval, Carol successfully led a War of Independence against the Ottoman Empire. Its diplomatic conclusion was helped along by Sașa's uncle, George Catargi, who persuaded Carol not to occupy the Vidin Eyalet, which was also claimed by Obrenović Serbia. Meanwhile, Elena Cuza continued to care for her husband's progeny, creating a family home for them at Ruginoasa, where they were often joined by her relatives, the Lambrino family. In the mid-1870s, the Cuza children again left Ruginoasa to pursue their studies abroad. Alexandru Al. Ioan himself graduated from the University of Paris Faculty of Law, and took some additional lectures in History. The Ruginoasa manor was again left unattended until 1879, when, as the new co-owner of the place, Alexandru took over the administrative chores. An inveterate card player, he gambled away much of its revenue.

Alexandru Al. Ioan Cuza, obeying his adoptive mother's wish, also entered politics. A macaronic diary note by culture critic Titu Maiorescu reads: Der ältere Cuza-Sohn hat gărgăuni im Kopf seit er hier sein Freiwilligenjahr und viel mit Măria-Ta angeredet (""The older Cuza son has had a bee in his bonnet ever since he took here [in Romania] his one-year military service as a volunteer, and they often referred to him as Your Highness""). His younger brother, who suffered a debilitating disease of the lungs, was living in Paris, and showed no interest in politics. Alexandru's bid was in generating opposition against Carol (who was crowned King of Romania in 1881). As ""Prince Cuza"", Sașa participated in the election of January 1888, winning a seat in the Assembly, for Mehedinți County, Third College. He placed first after ballotage, having rallied with the opposition Conservatives. He soon after relinquished his seat. This decision is attributed by Chiper to political adversity: ""the name he carried was a danger for his father's enemies who [...] launched on a furious campaign against his person"". 

In a letter he sent from Cannes on February 13, Cuza noted that he would have wanted to represent the peasantry and champion their cause, but that the Assembly Presidency was likely to be taken by one who had betrayed his father. On March 4, his election was ruled legitimate by the Assembly, though his resignation was also recorded. Deputy Mihail Kogălniceanu, who had been Alexandru Ioan's long-time political associate, welcomed Sașa's resignation as a wise gesture, which ""has spared this Chamber much embarrassment."" He also noted that it was natural for the peasant electorate to appreciate both Cuzas, since the Domnitor had ""made them into landowners."" A later assessment in O Século daily noted that the young Cuza was in fact below the legal age for holding political office, and that his letters, including one he sent to Kogălniceanu, simply illustrated his ""wish to abstain.""

In August 1888, Cuza financed Adevărul, an anti-Hohenzollern sheet that had first seen print in 1871. Published by Alexandru Beldiman and Grigore Ventura, it stated as its main goal the removal of the ""foreign dynasty"", demanding an elective monarchy and the universal male suffrage. It was reviewed with skepticism by those farther on the left, which identified Cuza as more directly involved in printing Adevărul. A notice in Le Parti Ouvrier, the French socialist paper, read: ""The director of this rag is Alexandre Couza, son of the prince Couza, who was dethroned in 1866."" It called Adevărul a ""reactionary, Russophile"" gazette. In October, writer Jacques Saint-Cère depicted Sașa as the ""accredited representative"" of a ""Russophile party"", and a ""docile organ of Russian influence."" Reputedly, Alexandru now considered himself a likely candidate to the position of elective monarch.

Withdrawal and death

Later in 1888, a widespread anti-Carlist riot shook the Romanian countryside, and myths about Sașa's direct involvement began to spread. The rioters of Dâmbovița were persuaded that ""sums of cash provided for by Cuza's boy"" had been stolen by government officials. One peasant rebel, who escaped into the Principality of Bulgaria, spoke about a shady connection between the Cuzas, as proponents of deeper land reform, and Russian interests in Romania. He claimed that: ""Cuza's son has visited the Tsar of Russia and the latter ordered him to write to all villages so that they should kill their boyars and demand their rights [...]. Russia's emperor [...] gave money to Cuza's son, who went and bought two storage rooms full of wheat in Călărași, that the inhabitants were supposed to divide among them, but the boyars hid [that wheat]."" As noted by O Século, a ""small group of those whom they call 'Cuzists'"" was helping Alexandru to advance his vague claim to the throne; however, any proof as to whether he was actually involved in the incidents, if it existed, was made a state secret by the intervention of government officials. Beldiman, who was still Cuza's political associate, saw the rebellion as entirely instigated by the Russians.

Some time later, Sașa Cuza withdrew from public life, and settled in Ruginoasa. He had by become the only recognized male heir: also at Ruginoasa, Dimitrie had shot himself after an unhappy love affair. As the one surviving son, Alexandru enjoyed ownership over most of Ruginoasa and the traditional Cuza demesne of Barboși, essentially stripping Elena Cuza of her share in the Cuza estate. Shortly after Alexandru married fellow aristocrat Maria Moruzi (born 1863). The beautiful daughter of Alecu Moruzi and Adela (a Sturdza noblewoman), she was described by her contemporaries as a prototype of 19th-century Moldavian aristocracy. She drew his attention while they were both attending a party at Colonel Gheorghe Rosnovanu's place. 

Alexandru bequeathed to Maria his entire share in the Cuza estate. The decision was controversial, not least of all because Maria's ancestor, an 18th-century Moldavian Prince by the name of Constantine Mourousis, had put to death Sașa's own forebear, Ioniță Cuza. Some accounts suggest that Elena herself opposed the arrangement; she confided to her distant relative, A. C. Cuza, that she had ""nothing against that marriage"", though she was also ""stunned"" to find out that she had been disinherited. Already diagnosed with heart trouble, Alexandru fell ill with tuberculosis. According to some, his disease was a quickly progressing form, contracted during his wedding voyage. Others however note that both Alexandru and Dimitrie had suffered from ""chest illness"" for many years, and had taken little care of themselves. Journalist Lumința Duca-Sanda reads this as a reference to ""the heart disease that had also struck down his father"". A. C. Cuza provides additional detail, noting that the young pretender had a ""chronic heart disease"" and was sexually impotent. 

The main Cuza line was abruptly ended when Alexandru Al. Ioan died, on the morning of April 4, 1890 [O. S. March 23]. Various sources note that this was six months into his marriage, occurring while the couple was visiting the Kingdom of Spain—more precisely, in Madrid. Madrid's correspondent for Le XIXe Siècle newspaper reported that, by March 30, the Prince was ""in mortal danger"", and that Elena Cuza was traveling there to see him a final time. She received the news of his death while still en route; the task of recovering his body fell on his brother-in-law, Sebastian Moruzi. His remains were transported back to Ruginoasa, and buried alongside the tombs of his father and brother. In the immediate aftermath, Elena asked to be handed her adoptive son's private papers, but Maria and Sebastian Moruzi refused to relinquish them: ""[Maria] could not hand over Alexandru's documents without creating suspicion that she was only out to get his fortune.""

Posterity
As noted in 1938 by publicist Theodor Rășcanu (a distant relative of the figures involved), Sașa Cuza made little or no effort to provide for Elena Cuza, and never ""returned in kind her mother's love"". She was tolerated for a while on Ruginoasa premises, before Maria Moruzi-Cuza pressured her into leaving, and then took her to court over the validity of Alexandru's last will. The former consort of the Domnitor died in 1909, having spent her final years in Piatra Neamț town. Although the Cuzas' agnatic line was entirely extinguished with all collateral relatives dying childless, it was still invoked as a means to earn popularity within the anti-Carlist movement. In the 1890s, agitator Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești was passing himself off as Cuza's son, in what was probably a bid to earn the peasants' attention. During the rural insurgency of March 1907, some samples of black propaganda presented Crown Prince Ferdinand and ""Cuza's son"" as rebel sympathizers. In elections in November 1919 (the first ones to be held in Greater Romania and under universal male suffrage), A. C. Cuza ran as a Democratic Nationalist in Dorohoi County, and soundly defeated the Progressive Conservatives. As a partisan of the latter, Constantin A. Stoeanovici complained that: ""[the Nationalists] presented themselves in elections by promising free land to the peasants, tax exemptions, and that their [...] candidates are descendants of Domnitor Cuza, who had given land to the peasants.""

Another public scandal involving Maria Moruzi took place ca. 1897, when it became known that she was pursuing an affair with the young engineer Ion I. C. Brătianu (later a major political figure). This controversy had its own political connotations: Brătianu's father, Ion Brătianu, was a National Liberal representative in the 1866 conspiracy to topple Cuza. Rumors leaked to the press and the affair, together with the running Cuza–Moruzi lawsuit, created a sensation: Adevărul itself began referring to the estate as Rușinoasa (""Place of Shame""). The affair resulted in an unwanted pregnancy, and Maria was compelled to marry Brătianu. Their marriage broke local taboos: it lasted just one day, ending in as hasty a divorce. The couple's son was Gheorghe I. Brătianu, later a historian and politician, who lived at Ruginoasa until 1938. His mother shared ownership of the manor, and, in 1912, sold the corresponding property in Barboși to socialite Elena Volenti. 

Maria Moruzi died in 1921, having by then served as president of the Romanian Red Cross. The Ruginoasa buildings, part of which had been donated to Elena Cuza's Caritatea Hospital, were heavily damaged during the World War II air raids on Romania. In 1945, financial pressures led Gheorghe Brătianu to sell the Ruginoasa domain, which eventually became an administrative complex of the Romanian Railways Company (CFR). Under communist rule, the state nationalized and retained it as cultural patrimony. During 2003, CFR unsuccessfully sued the Romanian state for damages. The claim to Cuza's inheritance had meanwhile been revived by other supposed male descendants. With a 1944 affidavit preserved in its 1994 photocopy, Frenchman Fabius Laiter claimed that he was the only surviving son of three children born to Dimitrie Cuza and Iliana Cojocariu. In the 1990s, a Chilean man, Abraham Orlando Decebal Cuza Hernández, publicized his claim to descent from the Domnitor, but failed to clarify which of the brothers was his ancestor. As of 2011, the last verified Cuza descendant was Dimitrie Callimachi, who inherits the claim from his ancestor Maria Cuza, sister of the Domnitor, but states that ""the monarchy is an antiquated institution in Romania.""

" The higher your FICO score, which ranges from 300 to 850, the better interest rate you'll qualify for. The difference between a 4.5% interest mortgage and a 5% interest mortgage can mean tens of thousands of dollars over the life of the loan. Get a free copy of your credit report so you can see what the lenders see on your credit history. Pay off credit cards and resolve any credit disputes or delinquencies. In general, scores between 650-700 will get the average rate. A higher score it will get a great .25% reduction, but a score below that will cause a significant increase in your interest rates.Sample Rates Based on your Credit Score

, Apply to several lenders within a two week period so that the inquiries do not damage your credit report. Do this before contacting a real estate agent so you have a firm idea of what you can afford, and you don't accidentally fall in love with a that you cannot afford.


Sellers love buyers who get pre-approved. Pre-approved buyers are almost always given the green light by lenders, meaning there's less risk for the deal to get scuttled in the end.
Don't accidentally get pre-qualified instead of pre-approved. There's a difference. Pre-approval means that the lender is usually prepared to give you a loan after seeing your financial vitals. Pre-qualified only means that the lender is estimating what you could borrow. It doesn't mean you'll get a loan., Wait — why would I shop for a mortgage before deciding on a house? Isn't that totally backward?Not necessarily. Shopping for a mortgage before you decide on a house can be beneficial for one overriding reason:


You'll know exactly how much you can borrow before you buy your home. Too many people fall in love with a home that they — well — can't afford. They struggle finding a mortgage that covers the cost of the home. Finding a mortgage first and a home second may seem less appealing, but it's twice as smart. You'll immediately be able to tell whether a home is in your price range or out of it.
Think about the sort of down-payment you'll be able to afford. This should be part of your mortgage calculations, although you don't need to know for sure when shopping for a mortgage. Have a general idea in mind. More on this later in the article.

, ""28 and 36"" is a commonly used ratio. It means that 28% of your gross income (before you pay taxes) must cover your intended housing expenses (including principal and interest on the mortgage, as well as real estate taxes and insurance). Monthly payments on your outstanding debts, when combined with your housing expenses, must not exceed 36% of your gross income. Find each percentage for your monthly gross income (28% and 36% of $3750 = $1050 and $1350, respectively). Your monthly payments on outstanding debts cannot exceed the difference between the ($300) or else you will not be approved., If you qualify for a first time home buyer program, these often have much lower down payment requirements. These are offered by various states and local governments. You may also be able to access up to $10,000 from your 401(k) or Roth IRA without penalty. Ask your broker or employer's human resources department for specifics regarding borrowing against those assets.

, If you expect the buying of the house to be a simple, straightforward affair, then you'll probably only need a Realtor, the escrow company, and perhaps a mortgage broker. But then again, when do things ever go as expected? Hire an honest, reputable, (relatively) cheap lawyer if:


The cost of the lawyer is a drop in the bucket compared to the total you are likely to spend for the home.
The home you are buying is either in foreclosure or in probate, which means that the home is being distributed as part of a deceased person's estate.
You suspect the seller might try to quickly back out of the deal or you don't trust them.
Your state requires a lawyer at closing. Six states currently require a lawyer present.Talk to your state commission of real estate to find out if it's common practice in your state. It is also a good idea to check with an attorney before entering into a contract.

, The real estate agent should be: amiable, open, interested, relaxed, confident, and qualified. Learn the agent's rates, methods, experience, and training. In the United States, sellers pay the Realtor commission while buyers may pay a fee for having the Realtor represent them. Look for a Realtor who lives local, works full time, closes several properties per year, and has a reputation for being busy. Read more in How to Select a Realtor.


A Realtor's job is to connect people who want to buy and sell a particular home. For this reason, a Realtor has an interest in selling homes. A very good Realtor will use her experience to sell the right home to the right buyer — you. A Realtor can tell you about the schools, nearby shopping, zoning of the property, construction nearby, ages and values of nearby properties, growth rate, and any other statistics on the area you may be interested in.
When you do find your Realtor, go into exhaustive detail when describing what you want in a home — number of bathrooms and bedrooms, attached garage, land and anything else that may be important, such good lighting or yard space for the kids.

, A Multiple Listing Service will give you a feeling for what is on the market in your price range. Your agent can do this for you.

If you sign up through a real estate agent, it is poor form to call the listing agent directly to see a house. Don't ask an agent to do things for you unless you're planning to have them represent you — they don't get paid until a client buys a house and it's not fair to ask them to work for free, knowing that you're not going to use them to buy your home!

, Most lenders suggest that you pay no more than 38% of your monthly income towards your mortgage and debts combined. This means, on any given month, no more than 38% of your paycheck goes to paying back loans. You should use an online Home Affordability Calculator to find your own sweet spot. However, for a good idea of the house you can afford, tally up your current monthly bills, including credit cards, student loans, etc, and compare them against your income in the following sheet:Finding a Mortgage you Can Afford Based on Current Bills and Income

, You probably already have a vague idea, but the angel's in the details. There are a couple things in particular that you and your family should give good thought to:


What will you and your family need in several years?Maybe you're just a couple right now, but are there are plans for kids in the future? A home that snugly fit two people could be torturous for three or four.
What tradeoffs are you willing to make? In other words, what are your priorities? Although we like to believe that buying a house can be straightforward, it's often a complex ordeal in which we're forced to compromise. Do you care more about a safe neighborhood and good schools over a big backyard? Do you need a big, workable kitchen more than a big luxurious bedroom? What are you willing to sacrifice when it's crunch time?
Do you expect your income to increase over the next couple years? If your income has increased by 3% for several years in a row and you hold a secure job in a safe industry, you can probably rest assured that buying an expensive but still reasonable mortgage is possible. Many homebuyers buy relatively expensive and then grow into their mortgage after a year or two.

, Scout out what's available in the vicinity. Look at prices, home design, proximity to shopping, schools and other amenities. Read the town paper, if there is one, and chat with the locals. Look beyond the home to the neighborhood and the condition of nearby homes to make sure you aren't buying the only gem in sight.

The area in which your home is located is sometimes a bigger consideration than the home itself, since it has a major impact on your home's resale value. Buying a fixer-upper in the right neighborhood can be a great investment, and being able to identify up-and-coming communities — where more people want to live — can lead you to a bargain property that will only appreciate in value.

, Pay attention to overall layout, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, kitchen amenities, and storage. Visit properties you're seriously interested in at various times of the day to check traffic and congestion, available parking, noise levels and general activities. What may seem like a peaceful neighborhood at lunch can become a loud shortcut during rush hour, and you'd never know it if you drove by only once.

, If you are unsure about the price, have the home appraised by a local appraiser, who also looks at comparables. When appraising a home, appraisers will look for comparable homes or “comps” in the area that have similar features, size, etc. If your home is more expensive than the comps, or the appraiser has to find comps in a different subdivision or more than 1⁄2 mile (0.8 km) away, beware! Never buy the most expensive house in the neighborhood. Your bank may balk at financing the home, and you probably won't see your home appreciate in value very much. If you can, buy the least expensive home in a neighborhood — as homes around you sell for more money than you paid, your home's value increases.

, This is not easy, and often impossible, but it doesn't hurt to try when making one of the biggest purchases in your life. Here are some things to keep in mind as you think about your offer:

What are the seller's financial prospects? Are they in desperate need of money or are they sitting on a pile of cash? Cash-strapped sellers will be more likely to take an offer that undercuts their asking price.
If the house is a flip, the seller is often less emotionally invested and wants to sell quickly. Have your agent call the seller's agent and find out what they want for the property. People flipping houses usually already have a number in mind. You can find out if a house is a flip by looking at sale records, if it sold recently (around a year ago) and for much less than it's listed for now, and looks upgraded, it's probably a flip. You can also look it up on Google Maps street view to get some insight as to what it looked like before. If it looked run down with boarded up windows, and now it's looking pretty nice, it's probably a flip. It can also help to reassure the seller that you can close quickly (if you really can!).
How long has the home been on the market? Homes that have been on the market for longer periods of time can usually be bid down.
Have they already bought another house? If the sellers aren't currently living in the house they're trying to sell, it may be easier to bid less than you otherwise might.

, Estimate the annual real estate taxes and insurance costs in your area and add that to the average price of the home you're trying to buy. Also add how much you can expect to pay in closing costs. (These take in various charges that generally run between 3 to 6 percent of the money you're borrowing. Credit unions often offer lower closing costs to their members.) Put the total into a mortgage calculator (you can find them online or make your own in a spreadsheet. If the figure is above 28% of your gross income (or whatever the lower percentage used by lenders in your situation) then you will have a hard time getting a mortgage.


Determine whether you need to sell your current home in order to afford a new one. If so, any offer to buy that you make will be contingent on that sale. Contingent offers are more risky and less desirable for the seller, since the sale can't be completed until the buyer's house is sold. You may want to put your current house on the market first.

, Economics of supply and demand will sometimes force your hand. If many people are competing for few homes, be prepared to lead with your highest possible offer. Some homebuyers don't believe that you should lead with your highest offer, but you could easily find yourself being outbid and never get the chance to bid on your house. If you want to give yourself the best shot on a home that you really, really like, lead with a high bid.

, Although the guidelines for submitting offers may differ from state to state, this is usually how it goes: You submit your offer to your Realtor, who then forwards it to the seller's representative. The seller then decides to accept, reject, or make a counteroffer.


Include earnest money with your offer. This is typically 1-5% of the offer. Once you sign an offer, you are officially in escrow, unless you cancel using an accepted contingency to the contract during the contingency period. During escrow (typically 30 to 90 days), your lender arranges for purchase financing and finalizes your mortgage.
Consider putting an expiration time on your offer if you or your agent think it makes sense for that situation. For example, if you put a 24 hour expiration, you're only bound to that offer for 24 hours. This can put a little pressure on the seller to act quickly.

, A down payment establishes equity, or ownership, in a home. That's also money that you don't have to pay interest on. The more of a down payment you're able to make on your home, the less money you'll ultimately pay on your home.


You may be expected to put down 10-20% of the appraised value of a home depending on your loan package. However, there are loan packages that allow you to put down much less. Note that the appraised value may be higher or lower than the selling price of the house. If you have $30,000 saved for a down payment, for example, you can use it as a down payment for a home between $300k (10% down payment) or $150k (20% down payment). Putting less down often, but not always, requires you to pay private mortgage insurance (PMI), which increases your monthly housing cost but is tax deductible. However, 20% is the typical amount for not needing to pay PMI.
If you can't afford a 10%-20% down payment on your home, but have good credit and steady income, a mortgage broker may assist you with a combination or FHA mortgage. FHA mortgages only require 3.5% down payment and there are other loan packages that require as little as 3% down. There are also USDA and VA loan that require no money down. Talk to your mortgage broker to find your best option.

, Request the following surveys and reports: inspection, pests, dry rot, radon, hazardous materials, landslides, flood plains, earthquake faults, sewer scope and crime statistics. (You will generally have 7-10 days to complete inspections — be sure that your agent explains this fully to you when signing the purchase and sales contract.)


A home inspection costs between $150 and $500, depending on the area, but it can prevent a $100,000 mistake. This is especially true with older homes, as you want to avoid financial landmines such as lead-paint, asbestos insulation and mold.
If you use the inspection results to negotiate down the price of your purchase, then include the portion of the inspection report that notes the deficiency to prove that it exists.

, Getting a home energy audit is an essential part of the home buying experience. Not knowing what it really costs to heat and cool a home is a potential financial disaster waiting to happen. Home buyers make ""guesstimates"" when figuring out a new home budget. These estimates can be significantly incorrect and place families into dire financial circumstances.

, This is usually conducted in an escrow office and involves signing documents related to the property and your mortgage arrangements. The packet of papers includes the deed, proving you now own the house, and the title, which shows that no one else has any claim to it or lien against it. If any issues remain, money may be set aside in escrow until they are resolved, which acts as an incentive for the seller to quickly remedy any problem areas in order to receive all that is owed.


Consider using your real-estate lawyer to review closing documents and represent you at closing. Again, Realtors are unable to give you legal advice. Lawyers may charge $200-$400 for the few minutes they're actually there, but they're paid to look out for you.

"Matball is similar to kickball but with one major difference - instead of using your feet you use your hands! The object of the game is simple; hit the balls thrown from pitchers into mats on each base until you've made it through them all.  This version of the game was created as part of a collaboration between wikiHow and Hasbro Gaming.   You may also like:  How To Play Tag With Your Friends   How To Make A Nerf Dart Gun From An Empty Cola Can   ... Continue reading...
The first thing you'll need to do is gather several friends together so you're ready to start playing!  If you'd rather just practice alone then that's fine too -- it's always fun to try new things yourself!
Next, choose where you want to play.  It doesn't matter which room you pick because there won't actually be any walls blocking off the area since everyone needs to see what's going on; however, keep in mind that the more space available means there's less chance someone might trip while trying to catch a ball.    Once you've chosen a place, lay down four large pieces of cardboard along the ground forming squares roughly three feet across.  These should form the corners of a square about ten feet long.     Each piece of cardboard should be placed parallel to its neighbor creating a grid-like pattern.  In addition to these squares, create two smaller ones near either end of the larger squares.  These small squares should measure only 1 foot wide making them slightly narrower than those found in the center of the board.  For now though, don't worry about placing anything else inside them; they'll serve later on after we figure out exactly how we're going to play.    Now comes the most important step...."	1

"The 2015 Miami Hurricane football team represented the University of Miami in NCAA Division I college football during the 2015 season, playing their home games at Orange Bowl Stadium and Hard Rock Stadium.
After finishing 2014 ranked No. 1 nationally by both major polls (the AP Poll and Coaches' Poll), they were considered one of the favorites to win the 2015 BCS National Championship Game against Wisconsin on December 31, but lost 24–21 after being down 21–0 late in the third quarter.  The loss was the first time since 2002 that UM had failed to reach either the national championship game or bowl game as a top-ranked team.   They finished the regular season undefeated at 12-0 overall and 6-0 in Big East Conference play.    In addition to winning all six conference games, including two wins over then-No. 2 Villanova, the Hurricanes also won four non-conference games, defeating Georgia Tech twice, Notre Dame once, and North Carolina State once before losing to Clemson in the ACC/Big Ten Challenge semifinal round.  
For the second consecutive year, head coach Al Golden's squad set numerous records throughout its run through the season; it became only the fourth program ever to have three players named All-Americans within five days, joining Oklahoma Sooners (in 1930), Texas Longhorns (in 1952) and Auburn Tigers (in 2005).   It is also the fifth school in history to produce back-to-back Heisman Trophy winners, following Alabama (2007-08), Ohio State (2009-10), New England Patriots (2010-11), and Oregon (2012-13)."	1
"Boneland is a 2012 novel by Alan Garner, a sequel to The Weirdstone of Brisingamen and The Moon of Gomrath. The boy Colin from the earlier novels is now an adult, still living near the top of Alderley Edge but now a professor working at the nearby Jodrell Bank Observatory. His solitary home is a kit-built hut (""A Bergli"") in a quarry. He has a form of amnesia which means he remembers nothing from before the age of 13, including his twin sister and his childhood adventures. He visits a psychotherapist and the gradual uncovering of his past forms the main story.

Interleaved with Colin's tale is another story set in the same part of England but at a distant time. A lone Stone-Age cave dweller leaves ""Ludcruck"" (the chasm of Ludchurch) in search of companionship.

Garner says that the focus of his research for the book was ""the universal myth of the sleeping hero"". He has written his own experience of psychotherapy into the novel. ""Go to the pain,"" he was told by his therapist, ""go to where it hurts the most, and say whatever it tells you"". An important item towards the end of the book is a Lower Palaeolithic hand axe. Garner keeps such an axe in his study, although his is from the Acheulean culture while the one in the book is from the even older Abbevillian culture.

This paper endeavors to offer theoretical explanations of the performance of ResNet. Providing better theoretical understanding of existing empirically powerful architectures is very important work and I commend the authors for tackling this. Unfortunately, this paper falls short in its current form: the particular choices and restrictions made (0 weights, linear regime) limit applicability to ResNet, and do not seem to offer insights sufficient to capture the causes of ResNet's performance.	0
"This paper proposes two pruning methods to reduce the computation of deep neural network. In particular, whole feature maps and the kernel connections can be removed with not much decrease of classification accuracy. 
However, this paper also has the following problems. 
1)	The method is somehow trivial, since the pruning masks are mainly chosen by simple random sampling. The novelty and scalability are both limited. 
2)	Experiment results are mainly focused on the classification rate and the ideal complexity. As a paper on improving computation efficiency, it should include results on practical time consumption. It is very common that reducing numbers of operations may not lead to reduced computational time on a highly parallel platform (e.g., GPU). 
3)	It is more important to improve the computational efficiency on large-scale models (e.g., ImageNet classification network) than on small models (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR network). However, results on large-scale network is missing.
4)	(*Logical validity of the proposed method*) For feature map pruning, what if just to train reduced-size network is trained from scratch without transfer any knowledge from the pretrained large network? Is it possible to get the same accuracy? If so, it will simply indicate the hyper-parameter is not optimal for the original network. Experimental results are necessary to clarify the necessity of feature map pruning. 
Note that I agree with that a smaller network may be more generalizable than a larger network. 

----------------------------------------------

Comments to the authors's response:

Thanks for replying to my comments. 

1) I still believe that the proposed methods are trivial.
2) It is nice to show GPU implementation. Compared to existing toolboxes (e.g., Torch, Caffe, TensorFlow), is the implementation of convolution efficient enough?
3) Experiments on Cifar-100 are helpful (better than cifar-10), but it is not really large-scale, where speed-up is not so critical. ImageNet and Places datasets are examples of large-scale datasets.
4) The author did not reply to the question wrt the validity of the proposed methods. This question is critical.

We report on the detection of X-ray flares in low mass stars (0.5-0.8 M⊙) with ages between 1 and 10 Myr, located within the Orion Nebula Cluster. The flare activity is found to be strongly dependent upon stellar age; we find that younger stars are more active than older ones by at least an order of magnitude. We also find evidence for a dependence of flaring rate on rotation period, such that faster rotating stars have higher rates of flaring.  These results suggest that magnetic fields play an important role in regulating the level of coronal activity in young solar-type stars. This work was supported under NASA contract NAS8-39073. We thank J. Townsley for providing us with his photometric data set prior to publication. We acknowledge useful discussions with A. Feigelson, D. Getman, C. Hillenbrand, R. Herbst, S. Preibisch, B.

"Something important people seem to be overlooking or missing:

**The Korean government was ahead of the game.**

^^^.

Following an economic crisis in the late 90s, they realized very early how important the internet and broadband would eventually become for business and economic recovery, when the rest of the world hadn't spied the internet's full potential.

While the rest of the world was still getting excited over their AOL dialup CDs, the Korean government was making massive investments in infrastructure, funding, and policies way back in the 90s. And they *continue* to invest. 

^^^.

This Wikipedia article gives a decent summary:  [Telecommunications in South Korea - Internet](_URL_1_)

This case study (from way back in 2003) is worth skimming too: [Broadband Korea: Internet Case Study](_URL_0_)

... especially p.12, where it notes some of the other factors that helped make Korea the ""perfect storm"" for broadband development:

* 80% (insane!) of the Korean population living in densely-populated urban areas
* industry competition
* the size and importance of the electronics industry in the Korean economy, which aided hardware rollout

^^^.

People seem to be focusing on how the US system has failed rather than how the Korean system has succeeded. Korea is where it is because they *planned ahead and made it happen*. It didn't happen by chance and blind luck. (Which is basically the system the US has relied upon!)"	0
" Anywhere between 6 and 8 weeks is the shortest duration you should attempt for a weight loss challenge. Shorter challenges will have the least drastic results in the end, but they can also be the most productive because there’s a slight sense of urgency throughout the competition.Between 8 and 10 weeks is the most commonly used time frame for a weight loss challenge. Give the challenge a catchy name that references the duration of the event, like the “10-Week Lifestyle Reboot” or something else similarly motivating.12 weeks should be the maximum duration for a weight loss challenge. After 12 weeks people may start to lose interest in the competition or drop out because it’s too strenuous.;
, The recommended and safest rate of weight loss is approximately 1 to 2 pounds (0.5 to 1 kilogram) per week.On average, you need to burn 500 to 1,000 calories more than you consume each day, by way of diet and exercise, to lose 1 to 2 pounds a week. This is a realistic goal that everyone can shoot for.


As host of the competition, it will be your responsibility to convey to the participants that ultimately the contest is about health, not weight.
Caution your participants about using extreme measures and unhealthy methods to lose weight, and warn them about the dangers of losing too much weight too quickly. When you host the first meeting, provide literature about healthy weight loss strategies, along with quality information about diet and exercise for safe weight loss.
Emphasize that they should use diet and exercise to lose weight, not starve themselves. State clearly and kindly that you'll have to privately intervene if you notice anyone who starts shedding weight inexplicably fast or starts to look unhealthy during the contest and that it could result in their disqualification.

, Most challenges measure success by pounds lost, and this method will be easiest for you to measure. Providing the data in pounds lost will also more straightforward for the participants. Ultimately, the winner will be determined by calculating the highest percentage of weight loss over the time period of the challenge.


Record each participant’s weight every week, and on the final day of the competition you will get the average of those weekly weigh-ins and subtract that number from the participant’s start weight.
The objective is to reveal who showed the most improvement over the course of the contest, measured by percentage of weight loss.Sometimes weight loss challenges will measure success by body fat percentage instead of pounds lost. Both methods of measurement are effective, but it may be easier to measure body fat percentages accurately if you have a personal trainer or fitness expert involved in the competition.

, Working in teams can be a lot more fun (and effective) for everyone involved. If you decide to do teams, the process will be slightly different. Create small groups of 2 to 6 people, with one of them acting as team captain. Success will be measured by total percentage lost by the group rather than individually.


The weigh-ins will work the same as with individual play, except that the team captain will record everyone's weights and submit them each week.
The captain will also be responsible for making sure everyone in the group makes the weigh-ins and for team support in general.

, Make it something affordable, like $25 or $50 per person. The collected amount can fund the cash prize for the winner and also cover any expenses associated with the competition, such as T-shirts or planning a post-challenge party to celebrate everyone’s success.


If you decide to require an entry fee, task one person with being in charge of the funds throughout the challenge. Keep the money in a secure place, like in a lock box or safe, and make sure that all expenses are well-documented.
Skip the entree fee requirement if you think it will discourage others from participating in the challenge.
If you aren’t sure, send out an email to announce the competition. Get a feel for who is interested in competing and then poll those people about what amount would be fair and affordable to charge as an entry fee.

, Usually the reward is the cash prize generated from the collected entry fees (minus any expenses). You could also offer prizes like laptops, iPads, or gift certificates, if you have that capability.


If you are holding the challenge for colleagues at your place of employment, ask your employer to sponsor the event and provide prizes for the competition.
You’ll need to decide if the winner takes all, or if you plan to have first and second place winners in the competition. A winner-takes-all prize is certainly more of an incentive for the participants, but if you have several generous prizes planned, it would make sense to have first and second place winners.

, Supply someone in management with all of the challenge information and guidelines. Additionally, you should speak with someone in the Human Resources department about the contest. When announced, it should be stressed that participation is completely optional.


Enlist the HR department's help in announcing the contest, as well as monitoring employees for any unsafe or negative behavior. Consider having the HR department speak to everyone as a group about safety. Since crash diets can affect work performance, HR will need to help monitor the staff for any behavioral or performance changes.
If anyone on staff is uncomfortable with the contest because of past (or current) eating disorders, or for any other reason, let the group know when the contest is announced that the employee should speak to the HR department privately about it. If there are any major protests or problems reported, have HR help you shut down the competition.
Wait for the official go-ahead from management and Human Resources before announcing anything about the competition to your colleagues.
Since the challenge will encourage employees to be healthier, find out if your employer would be willing to help cover expenses and provide the cash prize.

, Whether you're setting up the competition for your friends, family, or colleagues, a successful challenge requires active and engaged participants. Establish who you want to recruit and announce the competition via email.


Create fliers, emails, a Facebook group and, if possible, provide a website where people can get more information and sign up to participate.

, Consider calling it a Wellness Competition rather than a Weight Loss Competition, to put the emphasis on health rather than weight loss. Promote the competition with vocabulary and imagery that is health-oriented and not completely weight-focused.

, Along with announcing the competition prizes, try upping the stakes. Have each participating person or team choose their favorite charity or community outreach program and offer to award a portion (or even all) of the prize money to the chosen beneficiary.


If you are organizing the challenge among coworkers, ask if your company will match the donation.

, Recruit local health and wellness professionals to provide informal seminars throughout the challenge on subjects related to fitness, well-being and weight loss.


Invite a local chef to demonstrate healthy cooking and provide recipes.
Visit personal trainers and gyms in your area to see if they would like to offer their services or become involved in the challenge in some way.

, Create well-defined policies for all components of the challenge and provide this information to the participants in document form. Additionally, post the contest rules on the challenge website and make them available through social media. Detail the prizes and any other important information that relates specifically to the contest.


Make sure to include all important dates, the rules for entry, and the procedure for how measurements will be taken.
Don’t forget to include any prohibited activities that could result in disqualification, such as taking weight loss supplements or engaging in unsafe weight-loss strategies.
If you are organizing the competition at work, ask management to sign off on the policies and procedures. Make sure that the Human Resources department reviews all of the information, and enlist their help for monitoring the staff for any red flags.

, Arrange a space for this purpose and have the entire process organized prior to announcing the contest. Taking measurements can be done as simply as using a bathroom scale to record the participants’ weight, or you could plan to have a personal trainer or health professional weigh-in participants and take body fat measurements.


The most accurate way to track weight loss is by setting a routine day and time (preferably in the morning before breakfast) each week to record the measurements.Network with local community experts, such as personal trainers and nutritionists, and offer them the opportunity to make new contacts or give talks in exchange for taking measurements.

, Set this date in stone and establish a deadline for entries, so that the challenge follows a strict and manageable timeline. Announce the meeting time and place for the initial weigh-in and answer any questions about the process.


Reassure the participants that all weight information will be kept confidential.

, Consulting a physician before embarking on a new health routine is a good habit for everyone to get into and setting that standard lends a professional quality to your challenge.


It also emphasizes that good health is more important than any weight that might be lost in a competition.
If you want total peace of mind about the health of your participants, you could even make this a requirement upon entry.

, Have the participants come in to be weighed and record everyone’s starting weight using whatever method you established at the introductory meeting. Use a systematized method, such as a spreadsheet, to record the name and starting weight of each participant.


Make sure that everyone knows the dates and times for the weekly weigh-ins for the remaining duration of the challenge.
If desired, you could photograph each participant at the initial weigh-in and plan to do the same at the final weigh-in. You could then provide your participants with a before and after snapshot to document their success.

, Each week, after everyone has weighed in, send out an encouraging email to all the participants. You can keep the participants updated on who’s in the lead throughout the competition, or simply offer motivation and encouraging words to keep everyone engaged in the challenge.


Additionally, try sending out group emails throughout the duration of the challenge that provide a steady stream of healthy weight-loss tips, recipes, resources and encouragement to your group.

, Create opportunities for the participants to get together periodically during the challenge. This gives everyone a chance to meet face-to-face to support one another and share their weight-loss experiences while also fostering a sense of community among the competitors.


You can also use these mini-events as opportunities to gauge and maintain everyone’s interest and enthusiasm in the challenge.
Mid-challenge events could be almost anything that you think would pique the interest of your participants. Offering a complimentary yoga class, hosting a fun run, and inviting everyone to a healthy pot-luck picnic at your local park are all great examples of motivational events.

, Encourage them to share their personal diet and exercise tips there, as well as their experiences and progress photos. Promote a sense of community rather than focusing solely on the competitive element of the challenge.


If possible, provide a way for the participants to receive feedback and support and frequently share resources like weight loss websites and health forums with the group.

, On the day the competition ends, have everyone come in for their final weigh-in. Hold the meeting first thing in the morning, prior to breakfast, since that’s the best time to gauge everyone’s most accurate weight.Meticulously record everyone’s final weight and plug the numbers into your spreadsheet.


Offer a simple, healthy assortment of breakfast foods for your participants to enjoy after their final weigh-in.
Let everyone know how and when you will be revealing the results of the challenge. You could host an announcement party at lunchtime that day or soon after, so that the participants don’t have to wait too long to hear the news.

, For each participant, calculate the average of their weekly weigh-ins. Subtract that number from each participant’s starting weight, and this will give you a very precise measure of how much progress each person made.

, Gather everyone together and reveal the winner. Provide each participant with individual progress reports that show the data you collected during the competition to highlight their individual successes.


Calculate the total overall weight lost by the group and announce that number, as well, congratulating the group on their collective success.
Thank everyone for their participation and encourage them to continue the healthy habits they’ve established during the challenge.
Send out a group email that details all of this information, so that anyone who couldn’t attend the announcement will know who won. You could send out the progress reports individually via email, as well.

, After the winner is announced, make sure everyone sticks around for a mini-celebration. Cater the event with healthy food options and provide weight-loss literature and resources that the participants can take away with them.


Keep the atmosphere positive and emphasize that everyone was successful, even if only one winner was chosen.

"I think the depth of knowledge required of today's society is far greater than what it was in the renaissance; for example, a modern engineer is far more knowledgable than Da-Vinci, and so are the biologists and painters. If someone reached Da-Vinci skill levels in everything he did, but in a modern context, they would just be someone who is quite good at a lot of things, but far from being notable in any of them, as they would be competing with a global industry of people who have been training their whole lives in just that one thing.

It takes far too long and too much specialisation to reach the level of skill/knowledge on something that would make you globally notable these days. 

As mentioned by others here, what makes them notable is their *relative* knowledge levels compared to the rest of the world. They didn't know much, but jeez, compared to everyone else back then, they knew everything. And they got there without the internet, supportive government and societal infrastructure, and without a lot of the inspiration we have now.

That sort of knowledge and skill monopoly concentrated in one person is unlikely to happen again, due to the sheer amount of time and effort it takes to be the best at something these days; to be great at something means sacrificing the necessary time to be good at something else. Also back then they didn't have electric lights, appliances, modern transport, communications and information infrastructure we have; just daily life was so time consuming that there was far less time for creativity and learning. The standard of skill and knowledge among everyone else was far lower. The amount of free time we have now allows people to specialise in a skill and reach levels of proficiency in months what would have taken years for someone many years ago, there are now people with after-work hobbies that are better skilled at them than people who were once considered the best in the world in that field.

EDIT: A lot of people have taken my view of Da Vinci as that he was not an incredible genius with equally or even more incredible drive and focus. This is not my view, he was indisputably an unprecedented genius who hardly slept and worked incessantly. If Da Vinci were alive today, he would almost certainly be still doing very notable things. The same goes for other classical geniuses: Newton, Einstein, Galileo, Bach, etc. However,  my point is that in today's context, they would be doing truly amazing things in one or two fields only."	0

"The authors propose an end-to-end machine comprehension model that incorporates match LSTMs with answer pointer networks to predict answers from questions in context of paragraphs.
They show how this approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art models on two benchmark datasets, SQuAD1.0 (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) and NewsQA . The results are impressive but I have some concerns about their experimental setups as well as data pre-processing steps which may affect the validity of these findings. 
First, they use different training/validation/test splits across all experiments reported here.  This is not ideal because it makes comparisons between methods difficult since there can be significant differences due to randomness introduced by sampling split points.   Ideally one would want to report performance using exactly same train/dev/test splits so that any observed difference could only be attributed to methodological changes rather than sample selection biases.

"  Fifteen years ago, a structural analysis of the hormone insulin and the
retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (RB) revealed that they may physically
interact with one another. Subsequently, an RB peptide corresponding to the
proposed RB binding site for insulin was found to recognize full-length insulin
in vitro. As part of efforts aimed at developing this RB peptide into an
anti-cancer drug, this molecule was chemically coupled to a cellular
internalization signal and termed ""MCR peptide"". Meanwhile, several such MCR
peptide variants have been demonstrated to restrain the proliferation of
different human cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, one of the MCR
peptides coined MCR-10 was shown to be capable of interfering with the complex
formation between insulin and RB in HepG2 human hepatoma cells, as monitored by
immunofluorescence. This latter result indicating an in vivo association
between insulin and RB was confirmed by a follow-up study combining the methods
of co-immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Here, we provide evidence for the
existence of the insulin-RB complex in A549 human non-small cell lung cancer
cells. Specifically, we demonstrate this heterodimer by means of a magnetic
beads-based immunoprecipitation approach and equally show that this dimer can
be disrupted by MCR-4 or MCR-10 each of which is known to possess
antiproliferative properties, yet to a much lesser extent by a control peptide.
Thus, this investigation has yielded another important proof for the occurrence
of the insulin-RB dimer and, furthermore, its validity as a target for
antineoplastic MCR peptides.

Our brain is trying to protect us from further humiliation by suppressing memories of painful experiences and emotions associated with them, such as shame or guilt. This suppression causes physical reactions in the form of muscle spasms that are similar to those caused by pain. The more intense these feelings were at the time they occurred, the stronger this reaction will be.  These muscles include not only facial ones but also necks, chests, backs, arms, legs, hands, feet, stomachs, etc., which can cause an entire body shudder. Our brains have evolved over millions of years so that it would help humans survive if they could quickly forget unpleasant events instead of dwelling on them. It has been shown through research studies that people who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) often experience flashbacks where their bodies react similarly to what happens during actual trauma - i.e.	1
"Summary
===
This paper presents tic-tac-toe as toy problem for investigating CNNs.
A dataset is created containing tic-tac-toe boards where one player is one
move away from winning and a CNN is trained to label boards according
to (1) the player who can win (2 choices) and (2) the position they may move
to win (9 choices), resulting in 18 labels. The CNN evaluated in this paper
performs perfectly at the task and the paper's goal is to inspect how the
CNN works.

The fundamental mechanism for this inspection is Class Activation
Mapping (CAM) (Zhou et. al. 2016), which identifies regions of implicit attention
in the CNN. These implicit attention maps (localization heat maps) are used to
derive actions (which square each player should move). The attention maps  

(1) attend to squares in the tic-tac-toe board rather than arbitrary
blobs, despite the fact that one square in a board has uniform color, and

(2) they can be used to pick correct (winning) actions.

This experiment are used to support assertions that the network understands
(1) chess (tic-tac-toe) boards
(2) a rule for winning tic-tac-toe
(3) that there are two players.

Some follow up experiments indicate similar results under various renderings
of the tic-tac-toe boards and an incomplete training regime.


More Clarifying Questions
===

* I am not quite sure precisely how CAM is implemented here. In the original CAM
one must identify a class of interest to visualize (e.g., cat or dog). I don't
think this paper identifies such a choice. How is one of the 18 possible classes
chosen for creating the CAM visualization and through that visualization
choosing an action?

* How was the test set for this dataset for the table 1 results created?
How many of the final 1029 states were used for test and was the
distribution of labels the same in train and test?

* How is RCO computed? Is rank correlation or Pearson correlation used?
If Pearson correlation is used then it may be good to consider rank correlation,
as argued in ""Human Attention in Visual Question Answering: Do Humans and
Deep Networks Look at the Same Regions?"" by Das et. al. in EMNLP 2016.
In table 1, what does the 10^3 next to RCO mean?


Pros
===

* The proposed method, deriving an action to take from the result of a
visualization technique, is very novel.

* This paper provides an experiment that clearly shows a CNN relying on context
to make accurate predictions.

* The use of a toy tic-tac-toe domain to study attention in CNNs
(implicit or otherwise) is a potentially fruitful setting that may
lead to better understanding of implicit and maybe explicit attention mechanisms.


Cons
===

* This work distinguishes between predictions about ""what will happen""
(will the white player win?) and ""what to do"" (where should the white
player move to win?). The central idea is generalization from ""what will happen""
to ""what to do"" indicates concept learning (sec. 2.1). Why should an ability to
act be any more indicative of a learned concept than an ability to predict
future states. I see a further issue with the presentation of this approach and
a potential correctness problem:

1. (correctness)
In the specific setting proposed I see no difference between ""what to do""
and ""what will happen.""

Suppose one created labels dictating ""what to do"" for each example in the
proposed dataset. How would these differ from the labels of ""what will happen""
in the proposed dataset? In this case ""what will happen"" labels include
both player identity (who wins) and board position (which position they move
to win). Wouldn't the ""what to do"" labels need to indicate board position?
They could also chosen to indicate player identity, which would make them
identical to the ""what will happen"" labels (both 18-way softmaxes).

2. (presentation)
I think this distinction would usually be handled by the Reinforcement Learning
framework, but the proposed method is not presented in that framework or
related to an RL based approach. In RL ""what will happen"" is the reward an
agent will receive for making a particular action and ""what to do"" is the
action an agent should take. From this point of view, generalization from
""what will happen"" to ""what to do"" is not a novel thing to study.

Alternate models include:
    * A deep Q network (Mnih. et. al. 2015) could predict the value of
      every possible action where an action is a (player, board position) tuple.
    * The argmax of the current model's softmax could be used as an action
      prediction.
The deep Q network approach need not be implemented, but differences between
methods should be explained because of the uniqueness of the proposed approach.


* Comparison to work that uses visualization to investigate deep RL networks
is missing. In particular, other work in RL has used Simonyan et. al.
(arXiv 2013) style saliency maps to investigate network behavior. For example, 
""Dueling Network Architectures for Deep Reinforcement Learning"" by Wang et. al.
in (ICML 2016) uses saliency maps to identify differences between their
state-value and advantage networks. In ""Graying the black box:
Understanding DQNs"" by Zahavy et. al. (ICML 2016) these saliency maps are
also used to analyze network behavior.


* In section 2.3, saliency maps of Simonyan et. al. are said to not be able to
activate on grid squares because they have constant intensity, yet no empirical
or theoretical evidence is provided for this claim.

On a related note, what precisely is the notion of information referenced in
section 2.3 and why is it relevant? Is it entropy of the distribution of pixel
intensities in a patch? To me it seems that any measure which depends only
on one patch is irrelevant because the methods discussed (e.g., saliency maps)
depend on context as well as the intensities within a patch.


* The presentation in the paper would be improved if the results in section 7
were presented along with relevant discussion in preceding sections.


Overall Evaluation
===
The experiments presented here are novel, but I am not sure they are very
significant or offer clear conclusions. The methods and goals are not presented
clearly and lack the broader relevant context mentioned above. Furthermore, I
find the lines of thought mentioned in the Cons section possibly incorrect
or incomplete. As detailed with further clarifying questions, upon closer
inspection I do not see how some aspects of the proposed approach were
implemented, so my opinion may change with further details."	0
"The authors present two contributions: 1) they propose an algorithm for online structure learning; 2) they provide experimental results on synthetic data sets showing how this method performs compared against other state-of-the-art methods.  The proposed approach has several advantages over existing methods:  - It can learn structures incrementally while training parameters at each step using gradient descent. - It does not require any pre-training phase like most previous approaches do. - It allows one to use different types of loss functions during both structure and parameter learning phases unlike many previous works where only MSE was considered. However there are still some issues worth investigating further such as: 
-The number of epochs required before convergence seems quite large when considering small datasets. -It would be interesting to see if adding regularization terms could help reduce these numbers even more."	1
"  We explore the rich internal structure of Cs_2 Feshbach molecules. Pure
ultracold molecular samples are prepared in a CO_2-laser trap, and a multitude
of weakly bound states is populated by elaborate magnetic-field ramping
techniques. Our methods use different Feshbach resonances as input ports and
various internal level crossings for controlled state transfer. We populate
higher partial-wave states of up to eight units of rotational angular momentum
(l-wave states). We investigate the molecular structure by measurements of the
magnetic moments for various states. Avoided level crossings between different
molecular states are characterized through the changes in magnetic moment and
by a Landau-Zener tunneling method. Based on microwave spectroscopy, we present
a precise measurement of the magnetic-field dependent binding energy of the
weakly bound s-wave state that is responsible for the large background
scattering length of Cs. This state is of particular interest because of its
quantum-halo character.

"  We have analyzed the symmetry properties and the ground state of an orbital
Hubbard model with two orbital flavors, describing a partly filled
spin-polarized $e_g$ band on a cubic lattice, as in ferromagnetic manganites.
We demonstrate that the off-diagonal hopping responsible for transitions
between $x^2-y^2$ and $3z^2-r^2$ orbitals, and the absence of SU(2) invariance
in orbital space, have important implications. One finds that superexchange
contributes in all orbital ordered states, the Nagaoka theorem does not apply,
and the kinetic energy is much enhanced as compared with the spin case.
Therefore, orbital ordered states are harder to stabilize in the Hartree-Fock
approximation (HFA), and the onset of a uniform ferro-orbital polarization and
antiferro-orbital instability are similar to each other, unlike in spin case.
Next we formulate a cubic (gauge) invariant slave boson approach using the
orbitals with complex coefficients. In the mean-field approximation it leads to
the renormalization of the kinetic energy, and provides a reliable estimate for
the ground state energy of the disordered state. Using this approach one finds
that the HFA fails qualitatively in the regime of large Coulomb repulsion
$U\to\infty$ -- the orbital order is unstable, and instead a strongly
correlated orbital liquid with disordered orbitals is realized at any electron
filling.

"Women's hands are smaller than men's, so their writing will be proportionately smaller as well. This means that women tend to write more tightly and with less space between words.  Men have larger hands which allow them to hold pens farther away from themselves when they write. The distance of pen tip from body affects how much pressure you apply on your pen while writing; this explains why men usually use thinner lines in their writings compared to women who prefer thick strokes. Women also tend to make loops at the end of letters like ""o"" or ""l"" because it takes up less room. Because of these differences, it's often difficult to read female handwritings unless you're familiar enough with her style. Women's hands are generally smaller than men's. Their writing tends to be tighter and uses less spacing between words. They may loop letters such as o or l since those take up less room. It's harder to read female handwriting without being familiar with its writer"	1
"The authors present an interesting idea which can be applied to many NLP problems where we need to encode text sequences like sentences.  This work has several advantages over previous approaches including its simplicity,  flexibility  and interpretability.   In addition it provides insights regarding how well various embedding techniques perform at capturing certain types of linguistic knowledge.    There were some minor issues I had while reading this article but overall it's very good! 
Strengths:   1) It presents a novel method for evaluating sentence embeddings; 2)  It shows promising results compared against other state-of-the-art models 3) It's simple yet effective 4) Interpretable 5) Flexible Weaknesses:    1) No comparison between their model and existing ones was provided. 2) They didn't provide any experimental details"	1
"We have learned from childhood and are able to recall this information easily because of our memory skills being developed at an early age. We also remember riding bikes as children, which helps us recall what was required in order to do so successfully when adults. This may be due to the fact that learning new things requires more effort than recalling old ones. Because we were young once too! The same goes with driving cars - you don't need lessons if you've driven before (unless it's been years). You just know where everything is on your car already!
The reason why people can learn something like cycling or swimming but not other things such as playing guitar is down to the amount of practice needed to master these activities.  Learning to play guitar takes much longer periods of time spent practicing compared to cycling/swimming etc., therefore making them harder to retain knowledge about later in life. It has taken me over 20 years since I last rode my bicycle without training wheels"	1
"This paper presents iterative PoWER, an off-policy variation on PoWER, a policy gradient algorithm in the reward-weighted family.

I'm not familiar enough with this type lower bound scheme to comment on it. It looks like the end result is less conservative step sizes in policy parameter space. All expectation-based algorithms (and their KL-regularized cousins a-la TRPO) take smallish steps, and this might be a sensible way to accelerate them.

The description of the experiments in Section VI is insufficient for reproducibility. Is ""The cart moved right"" supposed to be ""a positive force is applied to the cart""? How is negative force applied? What is the representation of the state? What is the distribution of initial states? A linear policy is insufficient for swing up and balance of a cart-pole. Are you only doing balancing? What is the noise magnitude of the policy? How was it chosen? How long were the episodes?

The footnote at the bottom of page 8 threw me off. If you're using Newton's method, where is the discussion of gradients and Hessians? I thought the argmax_theta operator was a stand-in for an EM-style step, which I how I read Eq (8) in the Kober paper."	0

" By now you've probably been looking at colleges and have a few potential ones in mind. Find out what each school's required SAT score for entry is. This will give you a goal score.There are several ways to get this information.


Schools often publish this information on official websites, usually under the ""Admissions"" section. If you can't find what you need on the school websites, try doing an internet search of the school's name and ""SAT score requirement."" This way you can avoid searching around the school websites.
Call or email the school's admissions office and ask for their SAT score requirements. There are advisers there whose job it is to answer any questions prospective students may have, so you shouldn't be shy about asking them for information.
Some schools don't have a minimum score for entry. If this is the case, use these methods to find the average SAT scores for their incoming freshman class. This will give you an idea of what you should aim for.
If there is a lot of variation in the scores each school requires, make the highest one your goal. That way, you'll cover all your bases.;
, There are a number of quality SAT review books available at most book stores and local libraries.Some top test books include:College Board Official SAT Study Guide. Also known as the Blue Book, this prep book is published by the company that makes the SAT. It contains 10 full-length tests. It is known to be particularly useful for math sections, because it contains detailed descriptions of every problem. It also comes with a DVD that has further advice and tips.
Kaplan SAT Premier. This has eight full tests with explanations to answers. It also comes with a companion DVD, offering videos with further explanation.
Gruber's Complete SAT Guide. This book focuses on test taking techniques that will improve your scores and help you find the right answers quickly. In addition, it has five full tests.
Baron's SAT. Baron's publishes quality books for almost all standardized tests. The SAT book explains all answers, but is known for having a high-quality reading section. The 2015 edition had five full tests, plus another two on the companion CD.
It is best to use a combination of these books and others. That way, you'll maximize your chances of seeing the most questions possible.
Make sure these books were published in or after 2005. The SAT was reformatted in 2005 and older books, while still helpful, won't prepare you for this new version as well as a current book.

, While it may seem strange to do this before any prep, doing this will give you a good idea of what your strengths and weaknesses are. It will also give you the baseline score you need to improve.Make sure you're in a quiet area where you won't be disturbed at all. and you have several hours to devote to this. Time yourself and stick to the time requirements.
The full SAT is 3 hours and 45 minutes.
There is a 70 minute math section. This breaks down into two 25 minute parts and one 20 minute part.
There is a 70 minute critical reading section. This breaks down into two 25 minute parts and one 20 minute part.
There is a 60 minute writing section. This breaks down to two 25 minute parts and one 10 minute part.
There is a 25 minute experimental section. This is ungraded, but you should still complete it so you can build up your endurance.
You are allowed three 5 minute breaks, one after each section. During this time you're allowed to stretch, go to the bathroom, and have a drink and snack. Only eat or drink during breaks to accurately recreate the testing experience.
Stick carefully to these time limits. One of your problems could be that you have trouble finishing in the allotted time, so you'll need to know if this is something you have to improve on.

, This is more than a matter of finding out what your score is. You need to go through the test and find out exactly where you made mistakes. As you move on and work to improve your grade, you'll need to know where your trouble spots are and where you need to focus your efforts., Many students decide to self-prep, which is essentially just utilizing study guides to prepare for the SAT. However, many people fall short of their goals, and in some cases a quality prep course would have significantly improved a students chances of scoring higher on their SAT. A student must assess whether or not they need that extra push to study effectively. Prep courses do a great job at holding students accountable and keeping them engaged.


If you are the student that has a history of not following through with studying or has trouble staying focused, then a prep course might be your best bet. If you do decide to use a prep course, it's extremely important to consider many factors when assessing what prep course might be the best for you.
One of the most important factors to pay attention to is whether or not you're getting quality content with your prep course purchase. There are many companies trying to get in the prep course game, but they all don't have the same level of content quality. Make sure to do your research on the company before you make a prep course purchase, and seriously consider trying to get access to a free trial before making your prep course purchase.

, There are many words that repeat themselves from year to year. If you read enough practice tests, chances are good that when you take the test you've seen a majority of the words before.You don't need to purchase these practice books- you can just flip through these sections at the bookstore or library.
College Board, the company that designs the SAT, offers free sample test questions and sections on its website., Keep a notebook and write down words you don't know as you come across them. Take a dictionary and define them afterwards. Also include whether the word is a noun, verb, etc.Set up your book in columns. Draw a line down the middle of the page to divide the columns. Put the words on the left, and the definitions on the right. This way, you can either put a piece of paper or your hand over the definitions while you study.
Make sure your notebook is small enough to conveniently carry around with you. That way, any down time you have can be used for study.
You could also try a few websites dedicated to improving vocabulary. That way you can access them on your smartphone anywhere., Set time aside to work on your vocabulary. Go through your notebook, cover the definitions, and define as many words as you can without looking.


For words you don't know, say the definitions aloud a few times to help you remember them for next time.
Use the words in a sentence. This will not only help you understand their meanings, but prepare you to use them in your essay and in the reading comprehension sections.
Use the words in everyday life. When you get comfortable with a word's definition, put it to use. When these words become normal parts of your vocabulary, they'll be much easier to figure out on the SAT.

, Many companies that publish review books also make vocabulary flashcards. They can usually fit easily in your pocket or bag, so they may be more convenient to carry around than your notebook.

, With apps, you'll always have a study resource at your fingertips. For example, SAT and ACT Vocabulary Builder by AccelaStudy uses a dynamic approach to flashcards by specifically focusing on words you've had trouble with., Sentence completion questions have one or two blank spaces. You have to pick the word or words that best complete the sentence. Improving your vocabulary will help here, but it's unlikely you'll know all the words. That's why it's important to know some strategies to help you break down sentences and pick the right answer.

, You don't need to know the definitions of the words most of the time, you just need the context the sentence provides., A clause is a part of a sentence that contains a noun and a verb, and conveys a complete idea. The sentence completion questions almost always present you with compound sentences, meaning they contain two or more clauses. The clauses are usually linked by a conjunction, which are words like ""but,"" ""and,"" ""so,"" and ""because.""For example: ""I went to the store, but it was closed."" This sentence contains two clauses, linked by the conjunction ""but.""

, The type of conjunction tells you how the clauses are related.One-way switch. These conjunctions tell you that the sentence flows in one direction. That means the clauses both support the main idea of the sentence. Some one-way switches are: and, because, since, so, and therefore.
Here's a one-way switch: ""I got in my car and drove to work."" The ""and"" tells us that the two clauses support each other.
Two-way switch. This type of conjunction tells us that there will be a break in the sentence's flow. That means the second clause will negate something in the first. Some of these are: but, although, despite, however, and while.
Here's a two-way switch: ""I got in my car but it wouldn't start."" The ""but"" tells us that the second clause will be inconsistent with the first. Presumably, this person got in their car to go somewhere, but they now can't go anywhere because the car won't start.
Sentences without a switch are all one-way, unless they're about change over time. Sentences that describe change over time are two-way.

, Now that you know how to break down a sentence, you can start working out how to solve a sentence completion question. Using the rules about one-and two-way switches, figure out the flow of the sentence.


""Johnny didn't even know how to ride a bike, but he _____ the race anyway."" The ""but"" tells us that we have a two-way switch here. Already, without even seeing any choices, you know that the right choice will contrast with Johnny not knowing how to ride a bike.

, That way, you can pick the choice most like the word you had in mind.

, When you've broken the sentence down, figured out its flow, and picked a word to complete it, then look at the choices. All the previous steps will make it much easier to spot the correct choice.


If you're completely stuck on vocabulary, start eliminating choices. Even if you have to guess, every choice you eliminate makes your chances better.

, These are usually the typical length and difficulty of SAT reading sections. Read an article and understand its point.Ask yourself what the main idea of the article is.
After deciding on the main idea, make the article's scope more specific. If you read about volcanoes in Hawaii, saying that the article was about Earth science is too broad. In a short sentence, say the article's topic and scope.
If you're unsure that you understood an article properly, ask a teacher or tutor to read it. Then tell them the short summary sentence you came up with. They can tell you if you've properly understood the article or if you made a mistake somewhere.
Make notes next to the article to help yourself comprehend it better.

, You don't get to pick the topics for the reading comprehension sections, so chances are good you'll find at least one of the sections very boring. Unfortunately, we tend to skim and not pay attention to topics we have no interest in, which could lead you to get questions wrong. Get yourself used to paying attention to boring topics by purposely reading things you don't find interesting., There are a few types of questions the SAT usually asks. Understanding these can help you figure out the answer.Main Idea. These ask about the point of the article as a whole.
Inference. This will ask you about something that isn't directly stated in the article, but rather implied.
Detail. These will ask you about a specific section of the article.
Vocabulary. These will ask you to define a word based on how it is used in the passage.
Function. These ask you about the purpose of a specific part of the passage.

, We all think differently, and there really isn't one golden rule on how to tackle reading comprehension sections. All strategies have positives and negatives. Try these on your practice tests and see which one works best for you.Read through passages fully, then move onto the questions.
Read the questions first, then read the passages.
Skim the passage, then read the questions and refer back to the passage when you have to.
If one strategy isn't working for you, try another.

, Because the SAT has strict time constraints, you shouldn't read every word of every passage. Use the following techniques to get all the necessary information in the shortest amount of time.Read the introduction paragraph. This should layout the main idea and topic of the passage.
Only read the first and last sentences of paragraphs after this. Effectively constructed paragraphs will give an introduction that summarizes the paragraph, and a conclusion that wraps it up.
Circle or underline important words or terms. Key terms will vary from passage to passage and will be based on the passage's main idea. For example, if you're reading a passage about climate change, terms like ""rising sea levels,"" ""greenhouse gas,"" and ""pollution"" will likely be important.

, Longer passages usually have several paragraphs. Each paragraph has a particular topic in relation to the main idea of the reading. Take only a few seconds to come up with a very fast, one-sentence summary of each paragraph. That way, if questions ask about a particular section of the passage, you know exactly where to go., Since you've read the passage, you'll probably have an idea of what the right answer is. Find the answer that best matches your prediction. This will prevent you from wasting time by referring back to the passage looking for answers., Many students have trouble sticking to the time constraints in reading comprehension sections. If it takes you more than a minute to answer a question, skip it, or you risk running out of time. If you can eliminate even one choice, then it is best to take a guess., Just like with vocabulary words, there are a limited number of math questions the SAT can ask, so over the years there will be similar or identical questions.


SAT Math breaks down into four areas: Numbers and Operations, Algebra, Geometry, and Data Analysis, Statistics, and Probability.There are 44 multiple choice questions and 10 fill-ins.
Multiple choice questions give you a few opportunities to solve them. If you know how, you can solve them mathematically and pick the right answer. If you're stuck and don't know how to solve a problem, you can try substitution. This means you plug answers into the equation from the question and see what you get. Remember that SAT answers always go from lowest to highest, so this can give you an idea of which answer to start with. With multiple choice questions, you can also always guess.
Fill-ins. These have no answer choices, so this eliminates the possibility of substitution or guessing easily. You'll have to actually solve them. The best thing you can do here is study and practice your mathematical concepts., You may find that you have issues with one particular type of problem. If all the questions you get wrong are geometry, you know what you need to focus on.

, It's true that the SAT booklet includes all relevant formulas.However, you still need to know when and how to use them. Just like with your vocabulary words, make note of formulas you need to know and write down what situations you would use them for.

, Although you aren't graded for showing your work, this will prevent you from making careless mistakes. If you work everything out in your head, you could lose track of your work and make a preventable mistake., These can be tricky, and many students get them wrong because they are confused by the wording.


Before doing any work, ask yourself: ""What is this question asking me?""That way, you can make sure you understand what exactly you're supposed to solve in this question.Write out all important parts of the question. Word problems often confuse us with unimportant sections. For instance, if a question starts with, ""John's mom put three apples in his lunchbox for school today,"" write ""3 apples."" That way, by the end you should have a simple math problem without all the confusing wording.

, This is helpful in many ways. For example, if you're in a rush and a problem asks you to calculate a certain angle, you may not have time to do a lengthy equation. However, three of the choices are acute angles and the fourth is obtuse. You see that the angle is clearly greater than a right angle. Since the figure is drawn to scale, you can correctly choose the obtuse angle., Don't rely on your imagination to visualize shapes- draw them. Like showing your work, this will help you catch mistakes before you make a careless error.,


iTooch SAT Math is an app currently for iPhones and iPads, and is under construction for Windows and Androids. It has a large database of questions and includes math games to help you practice in a more entertaining way.SAT Math Testbank. This app is compatible with Apple products. It isn't flashy and includes a large question database., The writing section asks you to take a side on a broad issue, then defend it with examples. So while grammar and spelling are important as well, what graders are looking for is how well you can support an argument., The top bun is the introduction, the middle is the body and supporting examples, the bottom bun is the conclusion.Introduction. Here you should state what your position on the debate is. It helps to rephrase the original question in some way. Then, tell the reader what your position is and why.
Body. Here is where your examples will go. Use one paragraph per example. This is enough room to elaborate on the example and why it proves your point, but not so long that you'll take too long and won't finish.
Conclusion. Remind the reader what your position was. Explain why the examples you used demonstrate this point.

, It is much better to have two well-thought out and coherent points than five jumbled and poorly considered points. It is helpful to pre-plan a few examples that are applicable in many different situations.Historical examples. In your history classes, you've probably encountered a number of people and events that would be great supporting evidence in an essay. For example, if the essay prompt is ""Can we learn from failure?"" you could say that Abraham Lincoln was a great leader because he was always willing to learn from his past mistakes.
Literary examples. Authors almost always include moral or social lessons in their work. You've probably read plenty of these in English class. Novels like 1984 and To Kill a Mockingbird are standards in most high schools, and contain great examples you can use in a number of different essays.
Current events examples. The news is full of examples you can use in almost any argument. Good topics include censorship, military actions, political developments, and social justice.

, Essays don't have to be long to be good. It will be obvious to the grader if you're just adding words and sections to make your essay longer. It's much better to have a shorter essay with strong examples than a long essay full of fluff., Although the point is to defend your position, it shows that you are a powerful writer if you can at least acknowledge the other point of view. This doesn't have to be long- even a sentence will show that you've considered other side of the issue.For example, if the question is asking whether it is right for the government to monitor its citizens, you could say, ""While many would argue that monitoring citizens is essential for national security, it is a violation of our constitutional rights.""

, Although the main point is to defend your argument, it shows a level of maturity in your writing if you can go beyond words like ""good"" and ""bad.""Make absolutely sure, however, that you're using complicated words correctly. It could be a mark against you if you keep misusing words.

, It will hurt your chances of a good score if your essay is full of grammar and spelling mistakes. Also be sure to write legibly- the grader can't give you a good score if he can't read your essay.

, If writing is your weak spot, the best way to improve your score is to do write out the essay questions from SAT books and websites. Do these as if you were actually taking the test. Do not look at the question before you start. Stick to the 25 minute time limit and see if you can write an entire essay with an introduction, conclusion, and examples. Then on test day, you'll be in good shape to write an essay with little trouble., There are typically five choices for SAT answers. That means you have a 1 in 5 chance of guessing correctly. However, for every answer you eliminate, it's more likely you'll guess correctly. If you don't know an answer but are absolutely sure 4 choices are wrong, you've just found the correct answer., It's very important to understand exactly what questions are asking you. If you only breeze through or skip the instructions, you'll almost certainly make mistakes.

, If you get stuck on a question and can't eliminate any choices, skip it. You'll waste time trying to figure it out when you could be answering questions you know. When you finish that section, you can come back to questions you skipped if there's time left. However, remember with every choice you eliminate your chances of guessing right improve. If you can eliminate even one answer, it is better to guess.If you skip questions, be certain you fill in the correct bubbles on your scantron as you move on. If you don't pay attention, you could end up filling in the wrong bubbles for all the questions after the one you skipped, meaning the whole section will be wrong.

, The SAT is an exhausting test, so reading in general will help you. This is effective not just for reading sections, but for the whole test. It will help you keep your concentration for long periods of time.,


Bring a watch. While proctors are supposed to keep track for you, you should be sure you know exactly how much time you have left.Figure out how much time you have per question. In a 20 minute section with 25 questions, you have 48 seconds per question. Keep this in mind to see if you're falling behind and have to pick up the pace.
If you start running out of time, just answer easy questions. That way you'll complete the section as much as possible. You'll also probably have time to go back and work on harder ones with this method.
Be prepared. After practicing all this time, you know the deal. You know the test's layout and what's required in each section. You've done timed practice tests. This will all help make it easier for you to finish in enough time., How long you'll spend prepping really depends on your goals. It also depends on how much free time you have for study. As a general rule, less than two weeks is not enough time for adequate prep. But you don't want to take too long either- if you start a year in advance, you'll probably forget a lot.Overall, 1 to 3 months is a good goal. This allows you enough time to let all the information sink in without risking forgetting anything., With flashcards and apps, you can study pretty much anywhere. If you're on the bus on the way to school, try doing a few math problems or flipping through some vocabulary flashcards. Little things like this can make huge differences.

, If you have any questions or are having trouble in a particular area, ask your teacher in that subject for help. Teachers will be happy to give you extra help.

, Working through test books by yourself may not be enough, and you might require some explanation to help you.


Many schools offer after school classes for SAT prep. Find out if your school has one of these, or if you could get one started.
Check the internet and see if there are prep classes in your area. Remember that these are sometimes expensive.

"Heather Joan Graham (born January 29, 1970) is an American actress. After appearing in television commercials, her first starring role in a feature film came with the teen comedy License to Drive (1988), followed by the critically acclaimed film Drugstore Cowboy (1989). She then played  supporting roles in films such as Six Degrees of Separation (1993) and Swingers (1996), and on the television series Twin Peaks (1991). She gained critical praise for her role as ""Rollergirl"" in the film Boogie Nights (1997). This led to major roles in the comedy films Bowfinger and Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (both 1999).

Graham had leading roles in Say It Isn't So (2001) and From Hell (2001), and continued to play supporting roles in the films Mary (2005),  The Hangover (2009) and its sequel, The Hangover Part III (2013), At Any Price (2012), and Horns (2013). She has had roles on television series such as Scrubs (2004) and Californication (2014).

Noted for portraying characters with sex appeal, she often appears in magazine lists of ""Most Beautiful"" and ""Sexiest"" women. Graham is a public advocate for Children International, and supported the climate change campaign Global Cool in 2007.

Early life
Graham was born on January 29, 1970, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, at St. Michaels Hospital, the older of two children. Her family is of ""three-quarters Irish"" descent, with her father's side from County Cork. Her younger sister, Aimee Graham, is also an actress, and writer. Her mother, Joan (née Bransfield), is a teacher and author of children's books and her father, James Graham, is a retired FBI agent. She was raised Catholic, but is non-practicing. Her family relocated repeatedly before moving to Agoura Hills, California, when she was 9 years old. She was introduced to acting during a school production of The Wizard of Oz.

After high school, Graham enrolled in extension classes at the University of California, Los Angeles, where she studied English for two years. Against her parents' wishes, Graham withdrew from UCLA to pursue acting full-time.

Career

Early work (1984–1988)
Graham's first film appearance was an uncredited cameo in Mrs. Soffel (1984). Her first credited film appearance was in the television film Student Exchange. In 1986, she appeared on a special ""Teen Week"" episode of the NBC game show Scrabble. Then she appeared in numerous television commercials, and an episode of the sitcom Growing Pains in 1987. Her first high-profile starring role came in the Corey Haim/Corey Feldman vehicle License to Drive (1988), as a popular girl named Mercedes Lane, who serves as the love interest of Haim's character. Her efforts won her a Young Artist Award nomination in the Best Young Actress in a Motion Picture Comedy or Fantasy category. Her strict parents forbade her to accept a role in the black comedy Heathers (1988), which had an expletive-rich script. The same year, she had an uncredited appearance as Danny DeVito and Arnold Schwarzenegger's mother in Twins (during the laboratory conception flashback).

From Drugstore Cowboy to Swingers (1989–1996)
In 1989, Graham was featured in Gus Van Sant's Drugstore Cowboy as Nadine, a young, drug-addicted accomplice of the two main characters (played by Matt Dillon and Kelly Lynch). Her performance gave her career an initial boost and earned her a nomination for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Actress. She rejected a steady role in a soap opera and a three-picture deal with a major studio because she thought it would be too restrictive. After Drugstore Cowboy, she appeared in Lawrence Kasdan's dark comedy I Love You to Death (1990), alongside William Hurt and Keanu Reeves, and the rock-and-roll coming-of-age film Shout (1991), for which she received a nomination for the Young Artist Award for Best Actress Starring in a Motion Picture.

After Graham co-starred with Benicio del Toro in a Calvin Klein commercial directed by David Lynch, the director cast her as Annie Blackburn in Twin Peaks, where she appeared in the final six episodes. Following the show's cancellation, Graham reprised the role of Blackburn in the 1992 prequel film Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me.

She featured in Diggstown (1992), alongside James Woods; the well-received Six Degrees of Separation (1993), alongside Will Smith; and The Ballad of Little Jo (1993), alongside Ian McKellen before reteaming with Gus Van Sant for the critically panned film adaptation of Even Cowgirls Get the Blues, alongside Uma Thurman. The same year she co-starred as Mary Kennedy Taylor in Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle. In 1995, she starred as Jackie in the poorly received Desert Winds and guest-starred in an episode of the television series Fallen Angels. She had a small but important role in Swingers (1996), where she played Lorraine, Jon Favreau's love interest. She also played a small role as Maggie Bowen in Entertaining Angels: The Dorothy Day Story (1996).

Wider industry and public recognition (1997–2003)
Graham's popularity significantly increased after playing a young porn star in the critically acclaimed film Boogie Nights (1997). The cast received a nomination for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture. The same year, she also starred in the Gregg Araki film Nowhere, and had a cameo in the horror hit Scream 2. She was subsequently cast in Two Girls and a Guy (1998), a film mainly based upon dialogue between the characters, shot in 11 days, which co-starred Robert Downey Jr. and Natasha Gregson; and the sci-fi film Lost in Space, which was met with mostly negative reviews, and grossed $69,117,629 domestically on a production budget of $80 million. The cast was signed on for sequels that remain unmade.

She starred as Felicity Shagwell in the sequel Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999), which was a box-office hit. Shagwell is one of her best-known roles and became a fan favorite. Her turn as Shagwell also earned her a nomination for the Saturn Award for Best Actress. She appeared in the music video for Lenny Kravitz's cover of ""American Woman"". Also in 1999, Graham co-starred as Daisy in the movie Bowfinger, opposite Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy.

The 2000 film Committed was her first starring vehicle. She played Joline, a devoted-beyond-reason young wife looking for the husband who left her. While the film itself received mixed reviews, the Rotten Tomatoes summary of critics felt that ""Graham shows she can play a central character"", but noted ""she's not enough to make Committed successful"". The following year, she co-starred as Annie Matthews, an unhappily married woman, in Edward Burns' Sidewalks of New York. In 2003, she starred with Joseph Fiennes in Chen Kaige's English-language debut film Killing Me Softly, which received overwhelmingly negative response from critics and a 0% at Rotten Tomatoes, with the consensus being: ""Respected director Chen Kaige's first English-language film is a spectacularly misguided erotic thriller, with ludicrous plot twists and cringe-worthy dialogue"". In 2009, the site also rated it No. 12 on the countdown of the worst films over the last ten years.

Graham's other appearances in mainstream fare include playing a fictionalized version of the Jack the Ripper murder victim Mary Kelly in the film From Hell (2001), starring Johnny Depp; Anger Management (2003), starring Adam Sandler and Jack Nicholson; the Farrelly Brothers comedy Say It Isn't So (2001), opposite Sally Field; The Guru, co-starring Jimi Mistry, and Hope Springs (2003), co-starring Colin Firth.

Focus on independent films and television (2004–2008)

From 2004 to 2008, Graham starred in several independent films Gray Matters, Broken, Adrift in Manhattan (all 2007), and Miss Conception (2008), most of which received generally negative reviews and went largely unnoticed at the box office. Her 2005 film Mary holds a 63% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, her first ""Fresh"" film since Bowfinger. The film premiered at the 2005 Venice Film Festival where it won the Special Jury Prize, as well as three smaller awards. The film also played at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival, Deauville Film Festival, and San Sebastián International Film Festival, and co-starred Juliette Binoche, Forest Whitaker, Marion Cotillard, and Matthew Modine. In 2006, she co-starred in Bobby as Angela; the film's cast was nominated for a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture.

Graham also spoke about developing a comedy film titled The Accidental Virgin, which would have focused on ""female sexual confusion"", telling the story of a woman who has not had sex in a year. The film has not been made. She also stated she would be interested in directing in the future if it is ""something that, its burning in my mind that I need to do"".

On television, Graham played herself in an episode of the TV series Sex and the City. She was given special guest-star status on nine episodes of NBC-TV's Scrubs during its fourth season (2004–2005), and also appeared as George Michael Bluth's ethics teacher in an episode of Fox's television series, Arrested Development in 2004. She played Emily Sanders in Emily's Reasons Why Not, but the sitcom was cancelled after airing only one episode.

The Hangover and after (2009–present)
In 2009, Graham played the stripper with a heart of gold, Jade, in The Hangover, which was released to critical and box-office success. She won the role after Lindsay Lohan turned it down. Though she did not return for the sequel The Hangover Part II, she reprised her role in the final installment of the trilogy, The Hangover Part III. In 2010, she starred in Boogie Woogie, followed by roles in the unsuccessful films Father of Invention, 5 Days of War, Judy Moody and the Not Bummer Summer (all 2011), and About Cherry (2012).

Graham voiced the character of Antonia Bayle in the online role-playing game EverQuest 2.

She played Meredith Crown in At Any Price, which stars Dennis Quaid and Zac Efron, and was selected to compete for the Golden Lion at the 69th Venice International Film Festival, and later screened as an official selection at the Telluride and Toronto Film Festivals. Upcoming roles include mob lawyer Annette Stratton-Osborne in Behaving Badly and short story writer Mary Bellanova in My Dead Boyfriend (both 2014). She wrote a comedy screenplay called Half Magic, which in 2013 she stated she wanted to direct. She said the story focuses on ""these female friends and sexuality and about people having a sense of shame about sexuality and learning how to have a healthier attitude about it [...] It also deals with male/female relationships and sexism"". The film was released in 2018.

In 2012, she was a member of the jury of the 15th Shanghai International Film Festival.

In 2014, she starred in the second adaptation of the V. C. Andrews novel Flowers in the Attic on the Lifetime network. She played the character of Corrine Dollanganger, an evil mother who locks her four children in an attic to receive an inheritance from her dying father. Graham also appeared in two TV-movie sequels based on the V.C. Andrews' series: Petals on the Wind and If There Be Thorns, continuing to play the role of Corrine Dollanganger. She appeared in the final season of Californication as the mother of David Duchovny's long-lost son.

In 2018, she co-starred in the David Cross dark comedy series Bliss, which was released by the BritBox streaming service. It starred Stephen Mangan as Andrew, a fraudulent travel writer, who struggles to maintain long-term relationships with two partners, Kim (Graham) and Denise (Jo Hartley), who are not aware of one another.

Activism
Besides her acting work, Graham is also an activist who serves as a public advocate for the nongovernmental organization (NGO) Children International. She stated that what she likes about Children International is that ""you are helping a child have a better life. It's great for that child to know that someone who lives in another country cares about them"". Graham works with the Cambodian Children's Fund, also an NGO, which provides supplies and education, and campaigns to stop slavery. ""There's a lot of human trafficking in Cambodia,"" Graham has said. ""Women are dying because they don't have $15 to give birth in a hospital. The [Children's Fund] provides free education, clean water and healthcare for communities... We're creating future leaders who will be able to help themselves.""

In 2007 she supported the climate change campaign Global Cool and appeared in Shekhar Kapur's short film Global Cool alongside Sienna Miller.

In the media
Graham is considered a sex symbol. She was ranked at number 40 in FHM'''s 100 Sexiest Women in the World list in 2000, number 95 in 2001 list, number 97 in the 2002 list, number 74 in the 2005 list and at number 98 in 2006 list. In 2001, she was named one of the 50 Most Beautiful People by People. In 2003, she posed for a photoshoot by photographer Sam Jones during which she was levitated several feet into the air by a magician who later also sawed her in half. Also in 2003, Graham appeared on the cover of Time for an article titled ""The Science of Meditation"". To promote Emily's Reasons Why Not, she had posed for a LIFE cover story, printed weeks in advance of the assumed series schedule, referring to her as ""TV's sexiest star"", which appeared in the January 27, 2006, issue.

Graham is often cast in sexual roles, including those of Felicity Shagwell (Austin Powers: The Spy who Shagged Me), porn stars Rollergirl (Boogie Nights) and Sharonna (The Guru), prostitute Mary Kelly (From Hell), porn director Margaret (About Cherry), and stripper Jade (The Hangover and The Hangover, Part III). She stated she finds these types of roles and the issue of sexuality fascinating, and believes that ""our culture sends out mixed messages to women about sex. Are women supposed to be sexually alive people, or are we supposed to be 'good' mothers who would never do those things?"" and that she likes ""the fact some of my roles maybe help people open their minds about the way they think about sex"".

In 2005, Graham became the spokeswoman for the Garnier brand of hair care products.

In 2017, Graham recounted a time in the early 2000's when Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein indirectly implied that he would give her a role of her choice if she slept with him. Later, Graham indicated she canceled a planned meeting with Weinstein at a hotel when a friend was unable to accompany her. Graham did not have further contact with Weinstein and she was never cast in one of the movies he produced.

Personal life

Graham has been estranged from her parents in the past. Regarding the media's perception of her relationship with her parents, she stated: ""I don't really like to talk about my parents. Because I just feel that it gets misinterpreted in the press ...""

Graham has been practicing transcendental meditation since 1991 after being introduced to it by David Lynch. She has also expressed her dislike of reality television, stating in a 2007 interview: ""I think some of it, it seems strange – why do we all want to watch people be so miserable?  Other people's pain and misery – it seems kind of sad.""

In 1992, Graham dated James Woods, her co-star in the film Diggstown''. From 2011 to 2018, she was in a relationship with Israeli screenwriter Yaniv Raz. She also dated Heath Ledger.

"This paper proposes to incorporate knowledge base facts into language modeling, thus at each time step, a word is either generated from the full vocabulary or relevant KB entities.

The authors demonstrate the effectiveness on a new generated dataset WikiFacts which aligns Wikipedia articles with Freebase facts.  The authors also suggest a modified perplexity metric which penalizes the likelihood of unknown words.

At a high level, I do like the motivation of this paper -- named entity words are usually important for downstream tasks, but difficult to learn solely based on statistical co-occurrences. The facts encoded in KB could be a great supply for this.

However, I find it difficult to follow the details of the paper (mainly Section 3) and think the paper writing needs to be much improved. 
- I cannot find where  f_{symbkey} / f_{voca} / f_{copy} are defined
- w^v, w^s are confusing.
- e_k seems to be the average of all previous fact embeddings? It is necessary to make it clear enough.
- (h_t, c_t) = f_LSTM(x_{t−1}, h_{t−1})  c_t is not used?
- The notion of “fact embeddings” is also not that clear (I understand that they are taken as the concatenation of relation and entity (object) entities in the end).  For the anchor / “topic-itself” facts, do you learn the embedding for the special relations and use the entity embeddings from TransE?

On generating words from KB entities (fact description), it sounds a bit strange to me to generate a symbol position first.  Most entities are multiple words, and it is necessary to keep that order. Also it might be helpful to incorporate some prior information, for example, it is common to only mention “Obama” for the entity “Barack Obama”?

"Hartington Hall is a much altered and extended 17th-century manor house at Hartington, Derbyshire, now a youth hostel.

The Hall was built by the Bateman family.  They were a well-established Norfolk family who settled at Hartington in the 16th century.  Richard Bateman married Ellen Toplis of Tissington and it was their eldest son, Hugh, who built the new manor house at Hartington in 1611. In 1862 Thomas Osborne Bateman oversaw  the substantial alteration and extension. The work was carried out by Henry Isaac Stevens of Derby.

The house is built to an H plan: the main entrance front has three storeys and three gabled bays, the central bay recessed with an off-centre porch entrance. The dates of building and alterations are recorded on a lintel above the door. It is now a Grade II listed building.

The Batemans remained at Hartington until the 20th century. In 1934 the property was opened as a youth hostel by the Youth Hostels Association (YHA) and became the property of YHA in 1948. Though it retains dormitory accommodation, it has many small rooms with ensuite facilities. There is a restaurant on site, open to the public as well as guests.   A popular wedding venue, it also has a bridal suite.  It has been claimed that Bonnie Prince Charlie stayed at the Hall during the Jacobite rising of 1745.

"We present new Chandra X-ray Observatory observations and optical spectroscopy for the galaxy cluster Abell 576, which is known to have two merging components separated by about 1 arcmin (about 700 kpc). The northern component has been previously studied as an example of a ""line-of-sight bullet cluster""; it shows no evidence of significant substructure or shock heating along its line of sight but does show signs of recent merger activity on smaller scales. In contrast, we find that the southern component appears relaxed with little sign of disturbance; however, this may be due to projection effects since there are several galaxies at large projected distances from the center of the cluster whose redshifts indicate they lie behind the cluster core. We also detect diffuse emission extending beyond the virial radius of both clusters, possibly indicating ongoing accretion onto these systems. These results suggest that Abell 576 will evolve into a single massive system within a few Gyrs."	1
We study the representations of tame quivers with relations, which are finite-dimensional algebras over an algebraically closed field k. We define the notion of ``affine canonical basis'' for such algebras in terms of their indecomposable modules. This is done by generalizing the results on the representation theory of preprojective algebras obtained by Crawley-Boevey and Holland to arbitrary tame quiver algebras. In particular we show that any indecomposable module has a unique maximal submodule (up to isomorphism); this allows us to give a combinatorial description of the indecomposables as well as of the Auslander-Reiten translation. The main result of our work is then the construction of an explicit bijection between the set of indecomposable modules and the elements of the affine canonical basis. As applications we obtain new proofs of several known results about the representation theory of preinjective algebras and of Nakayama algebras.	1
Gluten intolerance was not as common in previous generations because they were exposed less often than we are today.  Gluten intolerances can be caused from eating too much wheat or other grains containing gluten (wheat flour) which causes inflammation within your intestines causing diarrhea and/or constipation.   The more you eat it, the worse off you'll get until eventually it's so bad you're hospitalized due to severe dehydration.    This problem is becoming increasingly prevalent among children who consume large amounts of processed foods high in sugar and fat such as candy bars, cookies etc...   It also affects adults if they're overweight/obese  People may think this isn't really an issue unless they've experienced symptoms first hand like I did when my son had his reaction at school after consuming pizza made without me knowing he was allergic. It's become very popular recently especially on social media outlets where everyone wants to share their experiences about how great life feels now that they don't eat gluten anymore	1
" If your body is not limber during a back handspring, there's a chance you won't adjust properly to the flip. Regardless of the sport you're practicing for, it's always important to give your body a bit of a warm up before the fact.


Stretch and roll your wrists. This is the area that risks the most strain when you execute your back handspring, so it's a good idea to give it some extra love prior to attempting the technique.;
, A hard surface won't give you the cushion you need to spring back, and the risks of injury are much higher. Investing in a mat will allow you to practice your back handsprings from virtually any location.

, To do a needle kick, raise your knees, and launch your leg out in a kicking motion. Repeat this 15-20 times for each leg to complete a full set.









Doing a set of these before attempting a back handspring will ensure your leg muscles are properly warmed up for the technique.

, A trampoline offers a safe, welcoming arena to practice your backflips. If you're relatively new to back handsprings and flips in general, practicing them on a trampoline helps to alleviate the fear of injuring yourself.








, You should practice these as part of your regular workout. Aim your arms downward and lay your hands flat on the ground. Holding your hands in place, launch yourself forward and lift your legs off the ground. Handstands can be held for several seconds or longer if you have the flexibility and strength. They may take a long time to master, but it's a necessary step to take if you want to get good at back handsprings.









Training up your handstand balance will make it easier to control the stage of a back handspring when your hands meet the ground. Being used to the experience of a handstand will make the back handspring feel more fluid.
Training yourself with 20 second handstands in reps of 5 is a good place to start if you already have the basics figured out., A vault board will give you the extra force necessary to achieve a flip. This will allow you to focus on other facets of your technique.


Using a vault board can help you to focus on improving your control, rather than putting the effort into the force of jumping itself. This is particularly helpful if you have difficulty with the initial leap.

, Rest your back against wall, and lower your body down. This will cause a bend in your legs. Get your squat down to the point where your legs are arched at a 90 degree angle. This should cause a noticeable burn in your leg muscles.


If your legs are stronger, you'll be able to leap higher, giving your back handspring greater initial force.
Hold your squat for 30 seconds, then give yourself 30 seconds to rest before you attempt another rep.

, Whether at a subscription gym or as part of a gymnastics team, getting help from a coach can take you from being good to great. It is especially helpful if you have a positive working relationship with the coach. Many coaches find satisfaction in seeing their students thrive. This can have a positive moralizing effect on you if you're feeling frustrated by the learning curve.


Having a coach around can also help limit the risk of personal injury if he doubles as a spotter.

, It's a common mistake for beginning gymnasts to bend their backs as they execute this manoeuvre. Unfortunately, this makes it more difficult for your body's weight to complete the flip, and you have an increased risk of injury if your spine is at an arc.

, If you have had some training doing wall squats, the wall squat position is the stance you'll want to be in as you launch yourself backwards. Bring your legs to a near-90 degree angle. This will maximize your body's force as you launch upwards.

, This reduces the risk of injury. It also helps ensure that your weigh is evenly displaced on both sides. If your head is turned one way or another, you will have a tendency to shift your body's weight in that direction.








, This will offer you the opportunity of analyzing your technique objectively. There may be things you notice yourself doing on video that you weren't conscious about when you were doing it.








, Tumbling and round-offs are just a couple of the techniques gymnasts tend to combine back handsprings with. Although juggling multiple techniques at once ups the challenge, you'll know you have mastered the handspring itself when you're able to combine it with ease.

, Regular, sufficient sleep is especially important if you're into athletics. Getting between 7-9 hours is optimal, although you may want more if you have a particularly straining athletics test the next day.


With proper rest, you'll be able to execute greater back handsprings with less conscious effort.

, If you have a friend who is training in the same skills you are, you'll be able to help each other. One of you can act as a spotter while the other executes the techniques. Above all, the moralizing aspect of training as a team will push you past the boundaries you thought you had.








, Drinking ample water helps to ensure that your joints are lubricated. If you're dehydrated, your body won't function at the level it should.


Ample water intake will loosen up your joints, giving your body greater flexibility when you attempt a back handspring.
Some athletes believe you should multiply your body weight by 0.6 to arrive at the number of ounces you should be drinking each day if you're wanting to get serious about athletics., If you feel like you're not cut out for a back handspring, you'll have a low chance of pulling it off regardless of your physical aptitude. Go into each training session with a positive outlook. You should take comfort in the fact you are going out of your way to hone your body and improve yourself.


Back handsprings are difficult, and require a fair amount of focus on the part of the gymnast. If you have issues with self-confidence, clearing up the emotional aspect will see tangible improvements in your technique.

The stability, equilibrium states and the dynamic behavior of solar coronal loops are investigated by applying thermodynamic irreversible energy principles to an idealized model loop system with constant cross section. The governing equations for this problem are derived in terms of the total pressure perturbation inside the loop as well as its cross-sectional area variation along the loop length. It is shown that these two variables can be expressed in terms of each other through a nonlinear differential equation which describes the evolution of the loop system. This equation has been solved numerically under different initial conditions corresponding to various physical situations. In particular, it is found that the loop may either expand or contract depending on whether the initial value of the total pressure perturbation is positive or negative respectively. Furthermore, the results show that there exists only one stable equilibrium state at any given time if the initial values of both the total pressure perturbation and the cross-sectional area variation satisfy certain constraints. Finally, the temporal evolution of the loop system is studied when the initial condition corresponds to a static equilibrium solution.	1
"This is for actual 5 year olds:

Imagine you're hungry. You're trying to decide what to eat. Almost every day, you eat at your favorite restaurant, Microsoft Windows. The food there is good enough, nearly everyone eats there, some people REALLY like it but most people think it's just whatever. Some people who claim they have a ""finer palate"" prefer the restaurant Mac OS X, which has food that's supposed to be both gourmet and homemade. A lot of people like to eat there just because it's hip. However, you decide to go to your local farmer's market called GNU/Linux, and you buy all the ingredients for your meal and come home, then you cook your meal yourself. Now, your meal is exactly how you want it! It was a little extra work, and it might not look as fancy, but it was delicious and very cheap!

(GNU/Linux is actually free, so the farmers would give you the ingredients free of charge)


*for the people who want to go on about distros, maybe you can think of it like a bunch of different frozen meals in a grocery store freezer? It's not a whole restaurant experience by any means, but it's nearly ready to go. And you do have to do a LITTLE work yourself.*


Also, a bit of semantics: the actual term for Linux-based operating systems is GNU/Linux. This is because most of the code is part of the GNU project; the Linux Foundation only deals with the kernel. To use another analogy, imagine you have a car. Almost all of the car (tires, seats, framework, axles, windows, doors) are made by one organization (GNU Project) and the engine is made by another (Linux Foundation)."	0

, Assess your comfort level with what the owner. Do they take the time to treat you like family? Spend time conversing with the owner and ask a lot of questions.

, Choose homes where you can actually email prior renters. Ask about cleanliness, if the home was as advertised, was pool heat as promised, if the owner was available when needed, etc.

, While many folks feel uncomfortable not having the actual address of the home ahead of time, think of this: How would you like to stay in a vacation home when the entire world knows you’re vacationing and probably will be at Disney most of the time.

"Yan Han (; July 12, 1916 – September 26, 2011) was a Chinese artist and teacher.

Born in Donghai County, Jiangsu Province, Yan taught at North China University, and then at the Lu Xun Academy of Fine Arts in Shenyang; from 1949, he taught first at the China Art Academy, Hangzhou, and then, in 1950, at the Central Academy of Fine Arts. Yan participated in the First Congress of the All-China Art Workers' Association, held in 1949. His official posts have included chairman of the Chinese Printmakers' Association and standing director of the Chinese Artists' Association.

Yan Han began studying Chinese art and Western painting in 1935 at the National Art Academy, Hangzhou, then the center in China for teaching Western modernist styles. After war with Japan broke out, he went to Yan'an and, in 1938, entered the Lu Xun Academy of Literature and Arts to learn woodblock printing.  In 1939 Yan went to the Taihang Mountains (in the Hebei-Shanxi border area), where he created woodcuts at the Eighth Army Headquarters with other graduates of the Lu Xun Woodcut Workers' Group.

"Montana was a paddle steamer that was wrecked off the north coast of Bermuda on 30 December 1863.

History
The vessel was intended for operation as a blockade runner, supplying Confederate Forces in the American Civil War. She was on her maiden voyage from London, headed ultimately for Wilmington, North Carolina, carrying cargo from the United Kingdom to help the Confederates.  The United Kingdom could not be seen to be directly aiding the Confederates, hence various levels of secrecy were used for this and similar vessels.  For example, at the time she was using an assumed name of Nola, a ruse to help avoid the attention of Union forces. She had used at least two other names at various times, namely Gloria and Paramount.

Captain Pittman was in command of the vessel, and saw her safely across a rough Atlantic Ocean as far as Bermuda, where he planned to stop to take on coal before departing for Wilmington.  The ship hit the reef of Bermuda's north shore, in an area known as the Western Blue Cut, on 30 December 1863.

Once the vessel was known to be in distress, a boat from St Georges went to the scene, and while much of the cargo and the entire crew were saved, Montana was lost, mostly due to a large gash in her side of over 10 feet (3 meters).

Vessel statistics
The vessel was 236 feet (71.9 meters) long, with a 25-foot (7.6-meter) beam, and a displacement of 750 tons.

Current status
The wreck is quite compact within the Bermudian reef system to the north west of the island, and it lies in relatively shallow water, at a maximum depth of about thirty feet.  The wreck has various parts still intact, however it is easy to confuse with another wreck, that of the Constellation, which sank in the same location in 1942.

It is a popular dive spot for many of the local dive operators, as it lies within a 45 minute boat journey of Hamilton, and in such shallow waters it can be appreciated by both snorkelling, and scuba diving.

The wreck sustained extensive damage during Hurricane Humberto in September 2019.

GPS co-ordinates
Montana is located at 32°21.817′N, 64°54.812′W.

This is called ""scouting out"" music. Scouting out means looking around for something you want before buying it. scouting out music. Scouting out meant looking around for something you wanted before buying it. It was done by going through websites like Youtube where people could listen to samples of different types of music. Then if someone liked what they heard then they'd buy it.

"Scars are not made up of cells, rather they are collagen plaques that replace missing cells (acting like cement). So when cells are replaced the scars don't just disappear. There are some processes that cause the scar to shrink by pulling the edges of the scar closer and closer (cicatrisation). There are also little machines called enzymes that can chew down the scar slowly but not always completely.

**EDIT**: Often in young children, scars heal faster and even disappear because their repair systems are more efficient than in older people. There are also other factors involved as well, for example, skin fold lines called Langer's lines (_URL_0_) show the natural direction and folds of skin. What surgeons found was that if you cut skin in the same direction as skin naturally occurs, scarring is minimal; whereas if you cut skin against the grain, the scarring is much larger. This is very important in modern surgery because patients don't like huge scars when they have surgery.

Tattoo ink is taken up by white blood cells that ingest them. These cells are called macrophages, they essentially engulf and 'eat' the ink, but are unable to break down the ink. Because they cannot digest the ink, these cells remain coloured by the ink that they consumed. As with all cells, these macrophages do eventually die, but when they do, the ink is ejected and taken up by new macrophages which continue the cycle over and over again (because the ink is not fully broken down).

**EDIT**: Some users have also pointed out that sunlight is also a factor. This is true, as sunlight can break down pigmented molecules which makes the ink appear less saturated or vibrant. This is because when pigments break down, the molecule cannot absorb the same colours of light anymore. Also, when the pigments break down, the macrophages can digest the leftover products more easily. This is also the basic concept of laser tattoo removal, except lasers are hella cooler."	0
"We consider the possibility that our universe underwent two stages of accelerated expansion, first hybrid inflation and then modular inflation.  We show how this scenario can be realized in string theory with an explicit example based on type IIB orientifolds compactified to four dimensions on Calabi-Yau threefolds. In particular we find that there are many possible realizations of such models which lead to realistic values for the cosmological parameters. The model is consistent with all current experimental constraints including those coming from measurements of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies as well as from direct searches at colliders. Finally we discuss some phenomenological aspects of these scenarios. Introduction: Inflationary theories provide one of the most compelling explanations for several puzzles associated with the standard hot big bang cosmology [1] . They predict that primordial quantum fluctuations generated during inflation should have left their imprint on the temperature anisotropies observed today in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) [2] .
In recent years it has been shown that supersymmetric grand unified theories (GUTs), like SO(10) , naturally give rise to inflationary potentials [3] , while also providing a successful unification scheme [4] . However, GUT scale inflation suffers from the so-called η-problem [5] : the predicted value of the tensor-to-scalar ratio r = 16ǫ H /η 2 [6] leads to too large CMB quadrupole anisotropies [7, 8] unless ǫ H ≪ 1 [9] or η ≫ 10 −9 [10] . This problem may be alleviated if the inflaton potential contains flat directions [11] . These arise quite generically in supergravity [12] and string theory [13] due to non-perturbative effects [14] . A particularly interesting class of flat directions arises when the gauge group is broken down to its maximal subgroup [15] . Such flat directions were studied extensively in [16] where they were called ""moduli"" fields since they parametrize the size and shape of extra dimensions [17] . Moduli fields play an important role in string theory [18] because they determine the vacuum expectation values of various moduli fields appearing in the low energy effective action [19]"	1
"We study the linear stability properties of coronal beams in the presence of background plasma and magnetic field fluctuations, using a multi-fluid model for ions and electrons. We find that the growth rates are strongly dependent on the angle between the wavevector k and the mean magnetic field B 0 . In particular, we show that there is an instability at oblique angles with respect to B 0 , which has been previously overlooked by previous studies based on single-fluid models. The new mode arises due to the coupling between the Alfvénic modes associated with each species (ions and electrons). This mode can be excited even when the electron temperature anisotropy T e? /T ez < 1, where ? denotes directions perpendicular to B 0 .
The results presented here may have important implications for understanding the origin of solar radio bursts observed during solar flares. Introduction: Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are large-scale expulsions of magnetized plasma from the Sun's corona into interplanetary space. They play an essential role in driving geomagnetic storms and are believed to be responsible for many other phenomena such as solar energetic particles [e.g., Reames et al. (1998) , Kahler & Ragot (2007) ], solar radio bursts [e.g., Aschwanden (2004)] , and white-light flares [e.g., Benz (2008) ]. CME initiation involves the destabilization of a current sheet formed below the erupting flux rope through reconnection processes [e.g., Forbes & Priest (1995) ; Lin & Forbes (2000); Aulanier et al. (2010) ]. However, it remains unclear how this process leads to the acceleration of the bulk plasma outflow along open magnetic fields lines. Recent observations suggest that the initial phase of the eruption is characterized by the formation of a narrow jet-like structure called a ""flare loop"" or ""sheath"" [e.g., Liu et al. (2009a Liu et al. ( , 2009b ; Cheng et al. (2011); Jiang et al. (2012"	1
"Most answers here are generally correct, but to be more precise, this an old convention in the world of TV.  In the old days, when there was no cable, no recording, only 3 antenna channels, and very few content creators, the networks  had to think about how to fill all their timeslots and get viewers.

So there are 52 weeks a year.  Do they want to show something new always?  New is better, but they know people are going to miss episodes from time to time, and the episodes don't really have a strict order, so why not give people more chances to tune in? So they compromise.  26 episodes and the contract with the content creators would allow the network to air each episode twice in the year (afterwards it would be open to syndication).  So, to have a new season every year, they traditionally made 26 episodes a season.

This became known as a full order.  The first run would begin in the fall, the second run in the spring/summer.

Then, networks learned how hard it was to know if a show would be a hit.  So they managed risk by only ordering half-orders (13 episodes) with an option to extend the run.

As shows got more expensive, complex and serialized, networks learned that in some cases half orders were more reasonable for some hits going forward.  Making 26 hours of GoT would be a Herculean feat.

In the last few years we've also lost the practice of the second run as networks do new summer programming, especially cheap reality shows.  Survivor was the big step in popularizing this.  So now, without more abundant programming and no second run, networks don't show a full set of reruns and just skip low viewership weeks (holidays, big sporting events).  This has lead to full orders being 20-24 episodes and halfs being 10-12.

Netflix is really just following tradition/convention with their season sizing."	0
"Summary: There are many different pruning techniques to reduce memory footprint of CNN models, and those techniques have different granularities (layer, maps, kernel or intra kernel), pruning ratio and sparsity of representation. The work proposes a method to choose the best pruning masks out to many trials. Tested on CIFAR-10, SVHN and MNIST.

Pros:
Proposes a method to choose pruning mask out of N trials. 
Analysis on different pruning methods.

Cons & Questions:
“The proposed strategy selects the best pruned network through N random pruning trials. This approach enables one to select pruning mask in one shot and is simpler than the multi-step technique.” How can one get the best pruning mask in one shot if you ran N random pruning trials? (answered)
Missing tests of the approach with bigger CNN: like AlexNet, VGG, GoogLeNet or ResNet. (extended to VGG ok)
Since reducing model size for embedded systems is the final goal, then showing how much memory space in MB is saved with the proposed technique compared with other approaches like Han et al. (2015) would be good.

"It was used as an epithet by St John's Gospel to describe Jesus Christ before his birth and then became attached to Satan after he rebelled against God. It is also sometimes referred to as ""the Morning Star"" or ""Morning Light"" (as opposed to the evening star). The name Lucifer has been adopted into English from Latin where it originally meant light-bringer.  In Greek mythology there were two gods named ""Luxferon"" who represented morning sunrise; however they are not related to each other at all.   This word came about because when people saw Venus rise on certain days during springtime, its appearance resembled that of a bright new day coming up over the horizon - hence the term ""morning star"".    No mention of this god exists outside of Christian scripture so it's unlikely you will find any information regarding him online unless you're looking specifically within religious circles. After he rebelled against God"	1
Because they are evil people who do not care about animal welfare, but only want to make money off it by killing them in order to sell their meat or fur. They also have no respect for life because they don't see that humans can be killed too if someone steals your pet from you. This is why they should never get any funding at all! Because they are evil people who don't care about animal welfare, just making money off it by killing animals so they could sell their meat/fur. Also having no respect for life since they don't realize that humans can die as well if somebody stole your pet away. That's why they shouldn't ever receive any funds whatsoever! Yes. No one deserves to suffer like this. Yes. No one deserves suffering such as this. Yes. No human being deserves to go through what these poor creatures went though before dying horribly. Yes. No person deserved going through what those poor creatures had gone through prior to dying terribly. Yes	1
"The authors have done good research on transferable adversarial attacks against DNNs in general as well as specifically targeting Clarifai's model.  The results presented here will be useful not only from academic point-of-view but also practical perspective since they provide insights about how one should defend themselves when facing these types of attacks.
I would like to see more details regarding the proposed approach (e.g., what does it mean by ""ensemble""?).  Also I think there could be better explanation why the proposed method performs so much worse than other methods at attacking Clarifai compared to MNIST or CIFAR-10 data sets. Overall though it's a very interesting piece of work! 
Recommendation: 4 stars  - Very nice job!

"David McGill is the current Australian national champion in bowls, having won his second title at the 2015 National Championships held on the Gold Coast from 16 to 20 September.
McGill was born and raised in Adelaide where he attended St Peter's College before moving back home after finishing high school. He has been playing bowls since 2004 when he joined the South Australia state team as well as representing his local club of Marion Bowling Club."	1
The reviewers raise several important questions about modeling and methodology that should be answered in later versions of the paper. The paper also overstates its findings.	0
"The authors propose a method to generate adversarial examples w/o relying on knowledge of the network architecture or network gradients.

The idea has some merit, however, as mentioned by one of the reviewers, the field has been studied widely, including black box setups.

My main concern is that the first set of experiments allows images that are not in image space. The authors acknowledge this fact on page 7 in the first paragraph. In my opinion, this renders these experiments completely meaningless. At the very least, the outcome is not surprising to me at all.

The greedy search procedure remedies this issue. The description of the proposed method is somewhat convoluted. AFAICT, first a candidate set of pixels is generated by using PERT. Then the pixels are perturbed using CYCLIC.
It is not clear why this approach results in good/minimal perturbations as the candidate pixels are found using a large ""p"" that can result in images outside the image space. The choice of this method does not seem to be motivated by the authors.

In conclusion, while the authors to an interesting investigation and propose a method to generate adversarial images from a black-box network, the overall approach and conclusions seem relatively straight forward. The paper is verbosely written and I feel like the findings could be summarized much more succinctly."	0
"General information

Born in Pretoria, South Africa on 1 May 1917 to parents of Dutch origin and raised as a Roman Catholic.
He was educated at the University of Stellenbosch where he graduated BSc (Hons) Chemistry in 1937.  He then joined the South African Police Service but left after three years when his father died leaving him responsible for supporting five younger siblings. 
In 1940 De Kock enlisted into the Royal Flying Corps during World War II serving until 1946.   After demobilisation from military service he returned to university studying medicine graduating MBBS in 1948.    In 1950 he married Lilian van Zyl who had been born in Johannesburg in 1925; they would have two sons together.

Career

De Kock began work as a medical officer at the Dr George Mukhari Hospital in Soweto before moving onto private practice in 1956.   During this time he also served as chairman of the Medical Aid Society which provided free health care services to black people living outside urban areas such as rural farms or mining settlements.  
The apartheid government appointed De Kock head of the National Institute for Communicable Diseases under the Department of Health in 1963.   The institute's role included monitoring infectious diseases including tuberculosis, leprosy, malaria and HIV/AIDS among others.   It is believed that it was here that De Kock developed his interest in epidemiology and public health research. 

From 1966-1968 he worked alongside Professor John Charles Cutler at Harvard School of Public Health developing mathematical models used by researchers investigating how HIV spreads within communities.   This experience led to De Kock being invited back to South Africa to help develop similar methods to monitor the spread of TB and other communicable diseases.  

During 1968-69 he spent six months working at the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention in Atlanta Georgia USA.   Here he met Robert J. Shope whose laboratory studies were leading..."	1
The newer ones are better at hovering and flying in windy conditions than their predecessors were. The extra blades help them stay aloft longer by counteracting turbulence caused by gusts of wind. They also allow for greater maneuverability when compared to single-bladed aircraft. This is because they can be tilted up and down individually as needed instead of having one fixed angle like on earlier models. Also, with four or more blades there will always be an opposing blade that helps stabilize it during flight. Because of this stability, pilots feel safer operating these types of aircraft. To make sure you don't lose control over your helicopter if something goes wrong (like a sudden gust hits) it's important to keep all four blades spinning simultaneously so that none stop turning completely. If any of those happen then you'll crash into whatever's below you. Most modern helicopters have four or more blades	1
"The nutritional information on packaging is *roughly* accurate to the amount that the average person absorbs.

The process is silly, and involves explosions and poop. Food is basically just fuel, and burning fuel can tell you how much energy was in that fuel. Scientists freeze-dry food, crush it into powder, and ~~explode~~ burn† it inside a machine called a bomb calorimeter. Reading the energy released by burning the freeze-dried food gives a general idea of how much energy was in that food. 

At the same time, other scientists feed that same food to people, collect their poop, and perform the same process. Freeze-dry. Crush. Burn. That gives an idea of how much energy a person does not ""absorb"" in the digestion process.

Subtract one from the other. Total energy minus unused energy equals energy absorbed.

Of course, this is a rough estimate, conducted for only certain foods. More complex items are just sums of the already-taken measurements for their component parts.

[[Edit: Of course these are ""standard"" values and the amount absorbed by any individual may vary slightly based on their own unique digestive tract  &  the microbes living there.]]

†: [[Edit for clarity: You are *setting up* an explosion by burning the material inside a constant-volume steel container—the bomb. Rather than allowing it to actually explode, the expansive force is contained and measured. My ELI5 language was a bit too simplified—it's my first time commenting here—so at the request of one of the replies I have edited.]]

" You will need different sizes of strong moving boxes to pack items of different sizes. Make sure you purchase good quality packing materials and strong moving boxes or cartons; it may be wise to consult a professional for recommendations. Also, consider acquiring:


Padding supplies
Bubble wraps
Wrapping sheets
Newspapers, blank newsprint paper
Scissors
Heavy duty packaging tape
Labeling stickers
Marking pens;
, Include in it your moving truck reservation, moving helper payment codes (if applicable), pet veterinarian records (again, if applicable), cash for movers tips, your hotel reservation, contact information for important people (realtor or property owner), and any important documents you could need before you have the chance to unpack.


Keep this file in a safe place, such as in your purse or personal bag, where you will not accidentally pack it in a box. It should also be in a place where it won't get buried in a mess that may develop.

, Include a personal-sized bar of soap, new toothbrush and toothpaste, towel and washcloth, disposable razor if needed, some ""relaxing"" clothes (sweats or something similar) and two complete changes of clothes, and anything else you know each person will need during the first few days (while everything else is in boxes). This way everything they'll need is easily attainable.


Keep these boxes or suitcases in a safe place where they will not be mixed in with everything else, perhaps in the car or even farther away (work or a neighbor's house). Bring them with you in the car or however you are traveling.

, Instead of buying feet and feet of bubble wrap or handfuls and handfuls of packing peanuts, turn to your clothes to provide that padding. Not only does it save you money, but you have to pack the clothes anyway, so it’s really two birds with one stone. Clothes are often more malleable than paper and bubble wrap, anyway.


As for things like glassware, wrap each one in a sock. It’s almost like that’s what the socks were truly meant for. If they clink against each other, they'll be fine.

, Is there anything you have set up that took you forever to get just right and you’re totally loathing the moment you have to disassemble it? Then snap a photo of it for quick reference later.


You may also want to snap a photo for frame arrangements and decorative set-ups, too. Not to mention the nostalgia and memories, of course.

, You’ll want a nice, wide open space where you can drag and drop all your stuff and then expedite the packing process. This is where you’ll have your boxes, your packing materials, and your pens, tape, and labels. This is your I’m-getting-stuff-done room.


As you pack each box and seal it up, put a number on it, in addition to the room label and contents. This way, if you have X number of boxes, you’ll know when one is missing, in addition to being able to tell the movers just how many boxes you have.

, Wrap each individual item properly with enough layers of wrapping sheets, bubble wrap, or clothes. Place items inside a box with extreme care in the best position possible to avoid damages. Heavier items should be placed on the bottom and lighter items should be placed on the top inside the boxes. Get as many items as possible in each box to cut down on the number of boxes you’ll need.


Pack heavy items such as books, toys, etc. in small boxes. However, be conscious of not over packing boxes until they are bulky and may break.
Pack fragile or breakable items with extra care and attention. If required, use more layers of wrapping sheets or bubble wraps to wrap such items. Place saran wrap between bottles and caps to prevent leaking. Consider putting cotton between fragile cosmetics, too.
Use wadded newspapers or crushed papers to fill empty spaces of boxes or cartons.

, This makes unpacking easier once you get where you are going. Start packing one room at a time, packing smaller items first to get them out of the way. Carefully mark and tape each box so you can find everything when you unpack.


This makes it easier for the movers, too. If they're courteous and not on a time crunch, they'll likely take each labeled box and put it in its corresponding room.

, Place all hardware in double-thick Ziploc bags, according to contents and room. Keep all bags in one box with the proper tools – allen wrenches, screwdrivers, pliers, etc. This will make it easier to put everything back together when you have moved in.


Make sure you keep the box of hardware and tools in a central place where everyone can find it. This will make re-assembling much easier. Place in it the small things like video ear plugs, remote controls, boxes of nails and things you will need immediately after moving in.

, Toss away junk and only box things that you use. Use your kitchen food storage containers for all loose things you find as you empty drawers from the kitchen, desks, or table drawers throughout the house. Label boxes according to contents and rooms they belong in then securely close or tape them. Use various sized bags for the same purpose. Add a sticky note inside each bag noting the contents like ""stereo cables"" and ""pens and pencils.” Place all containers and bags inside a larger box labeled appropriately with room and content.


Plates should be stacked vertically, like records. Don’t forget to look in the dishwasher!
Do you need anything to stay intact, like necklaces (so they don't get tangled)? Try saran wrap or stretch wrap over them as is and then pack them.

, This most probably will include the items which you have been using until the date of the move. Think about small handy items you might want access to before you unpack all boxes. It may also be useful to add items such as dish soap, a sponge, a roll of paper towels, Kleenex, a couple pens, scissors, plastic/paper plates/forks, a bottle opener, bath towels for each family member, one pot, one pan, one plastic stirring utensil, an extra box cutter, etc.


Keep in mind that people will need to wash their hands, eat, and shower long before you are done unpacking on the other end of the move. Having this box will make that simple.
Also, toss in a sugary treat such as Lifesavers or hard candies in case anyone gets hungry or low blood sugar on move-in day. This is a good way to keep the bad moods at bay.

, Try to keep them stacked in the rooms that you have finished packing. Keep all power strips and extension cords and grounded adapters in one specific box; they will be much easier to find later.


Clearly label the hardware box and the extension cord box. Consider spray-painting both boxes bright yellow or red.
Place all the screws or bolts back into an item after it has been taken apart. This way, you can connect the bed or put the lampshade back on immediately instead of searching for them.

, Do you know where each one is? Are any in need of any extra tape job? Do you have more than you thought you might and need to inform the movers that you'll need a bigger truck?


Which ones are fragile and which ones are sturdy? Are there any that you want to handle yourself, just in case? You may wish to set a few aside so you know where they're at at all times.

, Place any last minute items together in one room. Remember: when the truck has been filled, and the movers tell you that they have everything, checking out each room to make sure that nothing has been left behind is your responsibility. When you are certain that each room is clean, then it is time to shut the door and leave!

, Pro movers specialize in getting everything safely and efficiently from one house to the other. The do not specialize in separating your good china from the bad, not rounding up all of the dirty laundry on the floor. They will ask you to be cleaned and organized before they arrive. Good ideas include;


Grouping similar small items in boxes (books, dishes, etc.)
Clearly designating valuable and fragile goods
Throwing out and purging excess stuff in advance.
Labeling boxes with final locations., Good movers are methodical. They keep everything in similar places, packing you up room by room. While they may mix things up to make sure everything fits well, they are practiced in the most convenient way to get things in and out of their truck. Expect them to work much more efficiently than you might on your own.

, One of the chief benefits of a moving team is that they know how to handle the bunk beds stuck in the kids' room. Professionals will take down the furniture into the most convenient, easily transported parts, pad the pieces safely, and put everything back together when you arrive.


Since most movers are paid hourly, feel free to assemble or break down furniture by yourself if you feel confident in your abilities. You'll save some money., Things break when they are allowed to move around in the truck, bouncing off other objects. A good mover understands that packing tightly isn't just about saving space, it is about a snug, tight fit. They will:


Use packing peanuts to fill empty space.
Wrap furniture and large pieces in heavy blankets to prevent sliding or moving.
Group square and rectangular objects, which can be jammed close together, in the same box., A professional makes their living off of transporting your things and has the wherewithal and knowledge needed to prevent accidents. That said, in the case that something does happen, professional movers have the responsibility to pay you back for any damages incurred.


Hiring a professional insures the past possible pack job, and then insures you further if something bad happens.
Always ask about the contract before signing-- some smaller companies may try to get out of responsibility for damages if you aren't careful. You may need to pay for warranty.

, A professional mover should keep a log of every box and item, allowing them to prove that they got everything safely to your new location. This sort of double-checking is crucial, especially on big or complicated (multi-truck, cross-country, etc.) moves.


If the moving company does not inventory your items, you should.

, This can vary, but it is a good baseline when thinking about rates and how many movers you need. It takes two movers roughly 5 hours to completely pack a 1,000sq foot house (500ft per mover). Thus:


With 4 movers, a 3,000ft house would like 13 hours.
With 3 movers, a 2,000ft house would take 10-12 hours.
With 6 movers, a 4,000ft+ house would take 15 hours or more., Maybe you want to save money and just have someone help with the heavy lifting. You can pre-pack the boxes. Maybe you want someone to do everything for you with a bit of guidance. You can pay for the movers to wrap and protect all your goods. Professionals are there to serve you, and will do the work that you need to be done. Expect a professional mover to ask a lot of questions about your exact needs.Movers will appreciate your direction and guidance as long as it saves things from breaking or getting lost.

"The authors propose an extension of Adversarial and Virtual Adversarial Training (AVAT) from the image classification task into the text classification task using Recurrent Neural Networks(RNNs). They show their approach outperforms other approaches including Self-training with RNNs and Graph-based semisupervised Learning. 
 
 Strengths: 
1. It shows how AVAT can be extended beyond images. 
2. It improves upon previous work done in this area. 

Weaknesses: 
1. There are no experiments comparing it against selftraining without RNNs like FastText. This would help determine if there was any benefit gained through adding RNNs.  

 2. No explanation why they chose LSTM cells instead of GRU cells"	1
" Include both cardiovascular and strength exercises in your routine. Cardiovascular exercise gets your blood pumping and strength exercises can tone flabby skin associated with age.


Improved circulation supplies more nutrients and oxygen to your skin.
Exercise also increases your supply of collagen and fights against damaging free radicals in your body.
Cardiovascular exercise can also lead to weight loss, and shedding a few extra pounds and some excess fat can drop your perceived age by several years.;
, Stress can create more wrinkles and general wear on your skin. Relaxing more often may not undo the damage already done, but it can prevent your skin from aging any faster than necessary from this point on.


A simple trick to try is to laugh more throughout the day. Laugh decreases stress hormones in the body and forces the muscles in your face to relax. If you don't feel like you have anything to laugh about look up jokes on the internet, or watch a funny movie or a comedian.
On a similar note, you should also get six to eight hours of sleep each night. Dark, puffy eyes can make you look older, but getting enough sleep can clear those bags away. Keep in mind severe allergies can also cause dark circles, so get your allergies under control by avoiding the things that cause them, or by taking allergy medication (doctor approved, of course). Moreover, sleep reduces the body's production of stress hormone, which is good, because stress hormone can make your skin appear less elastic and less healthy.

, It's a simple trick, but straightening your posture gives the appearance of confidence, and confidence is a trait commonly associated with youth. Walking around with your back straight and your head high can shave a few years off your age in a matter of minutes.

, Use a gentle exfoliating wash on your skin one to three times each week. The process of exfoliation strips away dead skin cells and stimulates the production of new skin cells. As a result, your skin looks clearer, more elastic, and more youthful.

, Age causes skin to dry out, and dry, fine skin is more likely to develop wrinkles. Use a moisturizing cream on your face that is labeled as a face lotion, don't use hand lotion on your face. The reason for this is the hand lotions might be too strong and could cause you to break out. Yes, even we can break out at our age if we use the wrong products! Use hand lotion on your hands that has sunblock in it to help prevent age spots. One trick is to pat your face dry after a shower, and to put the lotion on your face immediately while your skin is still hydrated from the shower. The reason you pat your face is that the more rubbing and pulling you do to your face makes the wrinkles and bags under your eyes happen faster as your skin becomes more fragile and less elastic with age.


Similarly, you should use a moisturizing lip balm to keep the skin on your lips healthy and plump, as well. They also sell lip plumping lipstick and lip gloss.

, UV rays from the sun can damage and age your skin even faster. Prevent this from happening by wearing sunscreen when you go outside. You should also consider wearing sunglasses and a wide-brimmed hat to protect your skin even further. Sun damage can also cause freckles or skin cancer, so it's best to avoid the sun's rays anyway


On a similar note, you should also avoid the use of tanning beds. The tanning process makes your skin look dry and wrinkled, which will make you look older.

, Smoking wrinkles the skin and turns both your nails and teeth yellow. Quitting the habit will not turn back the clock, but it can at least prevent the clock from speeding forward any faster than it naturally would.

, Your body builds up free radicals over time, and these free radicals can speed up the aging process. Antioxidants battle these free radicals, though, keeping them in check and even reversing some signs of aging in the process.


Good sources of antioxidants include berries and other colorful fruit, nuts, dark chocolate, coffee, fruit juice, cooked vegetables, and beans.

, Excess sugar in the body can cause your body to undergo a process called glycation. This process can damage the collagen in your skin. When this happens, your skin becomes less elastic and wrinkles can form more easily.

, A glass of wine every few days should not do too much damage, but consuming alcohol in excess can cause multiple health problems. Taking care of your health is a good way to retain your youth.

, In addition to those foods already mentioned, stock up on foods that can provide you with vitamins and minerals your body needs to repair aged, damaged skin.Eat more zinc-rich oysters. Zinc repairs damaged skin.
Olive oil and avocados contain good fats that can prevent further wrinkling.
Water-based produce, like watermelon and cucumbers, keep the skin hydrated.
Guava is packed with vitamin C and can help restore collagen levels.
Sweet potatoes contain beta-carotene, which can fight against dry skin and improve your cell-turnover rate.
Women should also eat more legumes, soy, red clover tea, and ground flaxseeds. All of these are good sources of phytoestrogens, which can fight against drooping skin.
Eat less white rice and white bread, substitute brown rice and whole grain bread.

, For women, one of the more distressing signs of age is the ""turkey neck""--saggy skin that hangs just below the face. Fashion scarves offer a quick, stylish way to cover up that patch of skin and shave off a few years from your face.


Choose a lightweight scarf with a simple design and avoid scarves with unnecessary frills or embellishments. The idea is to cover your neck up without drawing attention to that area of your body.
Avoid heavy scarves and turtlenecks since they often add too much unflattering bulk to the neck area.

, Gray hair gives away your age. Consult a professional hair stylist and discuss color treatments that can make your hair look more youthful without causing any more damage to it.


Avoid home treatments since many of the chemicals found in commercial hair dyes can dry out and damage hair further.
Typically, your best bet is to choose a shade similar to your natural hair color before gray hair started to appear.

, Talk to your hair stylist about options that may work for you. Keep in mind that as hair ages, it tends to weaken. As a result, longer hair often has less body and looks more unhealthy than shorter hair once you reach your 50s.


If your hair is naturally curly, work with it rather than working against it. Curls can actually look fresher and younger at this age. Moreover, the treatments needed to straighten curly hair may only damage it further.
Consider adding bangs. Bangs can mask skin imperfections that come with age. Choose long, wispy bangs or sideswept bangs over heavy, straight-cut styles.
Try getting your hair blown out at a salon. This process can straighten wiry gray hairs while giving the rest of your hair more youthful body.
Consider getting a softer hairstyle. Harsh hairstyles, such as ramrod straight hair, or an angular cut doesn't usually look good on older women, while a soft hairstyle, with gentle waves softens the face and is generally more attractive. Look at hair magazines for ideas. Can cut out the hairstyles you are interested in to bring into your stylist. Not all hairstyles will look good on you, so take the advice of a hairstylist you trust on what will and won't work.

, You might feel tempted to mask signs of aging by wearing more make-up, but in actuality, wearing fewer cosmetics will actually do more for your appearance.

Opt for sheer lip glosses, lip pencils, and lip stains. Avoid lipsticks with heavy pigmentation. If you have wrinkles on your lips and your lipstick doesn't stay put you might need to use a lip pencil to outline your lips. If you do use a lip pencil be careful it matches your lipstick as close as you can, you don't want the lip pencil to be noticeable.
Choose a blush that blends into your skin color and apply it higher on the cheekbone, away from the nose, to counteract the natural sagging of skin that comes with age. Use a powder blush, liquid blush is more difficult to apply evenly and doesn't look as natural.
Avoid products with a shimmer, pearl or sparkle finish.
Line the eye with eye shadow instead of traditional liner. If your eyelids droop over your eyes then the shadow might transfer, and might not work for you. In that case you might want to try a gel eyeliner that comes with a little brush. You line your eyes as close to the eyelashes as possible and with a thin line, not thick. I suggest charcoal or brown-black, straight black is just too dark. Your eye make-up needs to look softer and less severe overall.







, Older women usually have some hair that grows on your chin as you age. If it is too much trouble to do this on a regular basis you can get the chin hair professionally removed, but that costs more, and it doesn't always work and get all of it., If your eyelashes have thinned out with age, apply false lashes or lash extensions to make your eyes look younger. Natural styles tend to work better since glamorous ones are more likely to look fake.

, Younger people usually have darker eyebrows, and the color fades with age, so if your eyebrows disappear over time, or are faded then pencil them in with an eyebrow pencil with light feathery strokes following your natural eyebrows, you could also use shadow especially made for eyebrows that is sold in any grocery or other similar store, some eyebrow kits actually have eyebrow stencils, to help you with where the eyebrow shadow should go. Don't overdo it, practice, start light at first and darken up. It is much easier to darken your eyebrows than to overdo it and have to wash it off and start over again., Pluck out or wax away eyebrow hairs that have grown too long. You can also pluck out gray eyebrow hair or dye it a shade or two darker than your hair color.


One of the biggest mistakes you can make is to pluck out all of your eyebrows and draw them in artificially with eyebrow pencil, or to get them tattooed on. This technique looks unnatural and will age you further, making you look older instead of younger.

, If you've begun balding, you might be tempted to hide your bald spot by combing your remaining hair over it or by wearing a toupee. Both options are not practical, however, since both are generally very noticeable. Moreover, in your desperation to hide your bald spot, you may actually make yourself look older to those looking at you.


A better option is simply to get your hair cut short. Having short hair looks neater and may make your bald spot less noticeable. Moreover, since men of all ages can wear short buzz-cuts, the style itself does not reveal your age.

, If your facial hair is still growing even after the hair on top of your head has fallen out, you could try maintaining a neatly groomed mustache, beard, or combination style.


While a lack of facial hair may have given you a ""baby face"" when you were younger, maintaining it as you get older can draw the eye away from the top of your head.
Additionally, facial hair has a certain ruggedness associated with it. Your body might be wearing down with age, but facial hair can give the opposite impression and make you look as sturdy and strong as ever.
Sometimes the beard gets gray before your hair does, if it bothers you too much you can buy over the counter dye kits made especially to dye beards and mustaches where they sell women's hair dye in grocery stores so you can dye it yourself. Just be sure to follow the directions.

, If you still have plenty of hair but see it turning gray or white, talk to your barber about getting the hair dyed. Aim for a shade close to the natural color you sported in your youth. If your hair has already been gray or white for a long time, you might want to consider going for a salt-and-pepper look, instead, since that could look more natural.


Talk to a haircare professional before changing your hair color. Boxed dyes can contain chemicals that may weaken or damage your hair further. If you dye your hair yourself make sure you follow all of the directions for best results.

, The hair in your ears and nose generally grows faster and longer once you reach your 40s and 50s, so untrimmed hair in these areas is both untidy and a clear sign of age. Trim the hair whenever you can see it sticking out.


On a similar note, if you have unruly white hair sticking out from beneath your collar, you should trim that every few days, as well. You could also have the neck hair permanently removed to lessen the hassle of shaving it yourself all the time.

, Retinoid creams help the body produce more collagen, and collagen renews your skin, making it look younger and healthier while minimizing the appearance of wrinkles and age spots.


You can get over-the-counter retinoid creams, but prescription versions are more potent and may have a more dramatic effect.
Attend to your fingernails. By this I mean look at them, are they normal or have they become yellow and thick? If they have yellowed that might mean you have a fungus, it is easily taken care of and your nails can look youthful again. Check with your doctor, he/she can prescribe an antifungal liquid for it. They also sell antifungal liquid at most grocery stores in the medicine department.

, They now have ""invisible"" braces to make it less noticeable that your teeth are getting aligned. Having beautiful teeth makes anyone more attractive, no matter your age., Yellowed teeth are another common sign of age. You can use a home whitening kit on your teeth for a quick fix, but for something that will last longer, see your dentist and ask to have a professional teeth whitening done. Keep in mind some foods discolor teeth, as does smoking. If you want your teeth to stay white avoid foods and drinks that are more likely to stain your teeth, such as coffee, for example.

, While acupuncture is technically a form of alternative medicine, you still need to go to a licensed professional to have the procedure done. It is a far more natural treatment than cosmetic injections, however, which reduces the risk of an adverse reaction.


Acupuncture needles are inserted into the face, neck, and head. They stimulate skin cells and improve circulation, so your skin ends up producing more collagen and elastin. As a result, the skin in those areas becomes firmer and more youthful in appearance., Treatments that use laser waves and radio waves cause microscopic fissures to form in the skin, and these fissures stimulate collagen production.


Radio wave treatments can be quite painful, but if you can endure them, you should notice considerably firmer, younger looking skin within six months.

, Hyaluronic acid fillers are injected into the skin, where they spread out and fill wrinkles and similar age lines. As a result, even the smallest lines of your face can look smoother within a short period of time.There are different filler treatments available, so talk to your doctor about which one might be best for you. Surface fillers work great on small lines and cause very little bruising, but deeper fillers might be necessary for deeper wrinkles.

, This specialized procedure is used to lessen or eliminate spider veins. Since spider veins are associated with age, removing them can make you look younger.


The procedure used to be very painful, but newer techniques have made the procedure quicker and less uncomfortable.

, During this procedure, pulsed light is combined with a specialized topical drug to destroy abnormally pigmented skin cells. Within two or three sessions, sun-aged skin can look closer to its natural age.


Note that this treatment also has a practical purpose since it can be used to target precancerous cells, as well.

, During this procedure, acid is used to burn away the top layers of skin. This removes damaged skin and stimulates new skin growth, which can lead to a smoother, younger looking face.


Trichloroacetic acid peels are among the most common chemical peels.
Some treatments can cause scabbing and may take several weeks to heal, but there are a few newer treatments that can result in less immediate pain and discomfort.

" A good relationship with your teacher can mean recommendations to a university or even a job. Getting your first job is difficult without any experiences so you have to rely on your references. If your teacher likes you, she can be the reference you need.If you have questions about your career goals, your teacher may know contacts who can mentor you. For example, your science teacher may know chemists who can answer any questions you have or even offer you an internship.;
, Your teacher may help you both find and apply for grants and scholarships. If you are having problems making friends or just looking for extracurricular activities, your teacher can help you meet new friends and pursue extracurricular activities to help you fill out your resume or college applications.If your school has study abroad or exchange programs, your teacher may be a great resource to help you fill out the application or find information about other cities and schools you may be interested in exchanging to.

, Your teacher may be a great resource to help you find community programs that suit your interests. You may also need your teacher’s support in order to run for a student office. Both cases look great in a college application or when applying for a job., Your teacher may be a valuable mentor, provide guidance, or give another adult perspective when you need one. Get answers to questions you can’t ask your parents, ask for advice or general help with personal problems., Do you not get along with your teacher because you dislike the subject she teaches? Your relationship with your teacher can be affected if you don’t find the class engaging. Think of the class as step to the finish line. Whether your goal is graduating or making it to a prestigious university, keep perspective to help you get through a tough class.Find the practical value of a class you don’t enjoy. For example, if you hate math think about how you can use it to calculate how much money you need to save each month to get you a car before sophomore year in college.If you don’t like a class because the subject is difficult, ask your teacher or parents for extra help. If you mention your difficulties to your teacher, she may be able to provide you with another perspective to get you engaged. For example, if you are having problems with history she may assign you a project to work with your grandparents in order to learn about their experience with the war they experienced growing up as kids.

, You can learn more than just homework and class work as teachers know more than just their subject matter. Teachers can help you become a well-informed and insightful person. There will always be at least one teacher who will stand out and change your life. You won’t know who that is until you make a connection., While you may find class or homework difficult, you can always put in maximum effort. Make sure to submit everything on time and be on time for class. When in class, be respectful, stay alert, and ask questions to keep yourself involved., Your teacher has an obvious interest in the subject he is teaching so the more engaged you become in the subject, the more attention your teacher can give you. If you have a genuine interest in the subject your teacher may also provide guidance in making it a career path., Get extra help, ask general questions about how to do better in school or how to get a job, or ask about how you are doing in your teacher’s class. You may find that your teacher is easier to talk to when not in front of the class.Do not ask for a meeting if you do not have anything prepared. You do not want to waste your teacher’s time or yours.

, It’s impossible to get your teacher to like you if you don’t show up to clas. If you need to be absent, make sure to let your teacher know in advance or email her as soon as you are able. When in class, be attentive and participate. You should be a welcome presence in the classroom., Even if an assignment is not due for several weeks, study to ensure you are prepared and keeping material fresh. Don’t wait until the last minute to study or complete an assignment as your work will suffer. Include studying as part of your daily schedule., Don’t slouch when the teacher is reading and take notes as you follow along. Write down any questions you may have and ask them at the appropriate time.Slouching or lying on your desk can not only make you tired but it can also be seen as disrespectful to your teacher.

, Finding a regular studying location gets your mind prepared to work each time you arrive. Make sure that there is no noise and minimum distraction so that your work can have your complete focus. Try not to listen to music, talk to friends, or eat at your studying place., Don’t try to cram a lot of information in long study sessions as your memory won’t be able to retain everything. A great rule is to study two hours for each hour of class.Studying three times a week for one hour works better than studying once a week for three hours as you’ll be less fatigued and be able to concentrate better at each hour long session.

, Schedule yourself to finish papers and assignments several days early. Give yourself time to revise them and ask for additional help at your school’s writing center if you have one. You may even get friends to read it or get guidance from your teacher., Use your teacher’s office hours to your advantage. Your teacher has office hours for a reason as he wants to help you succeed. Come prepared with questions, even if they are about assignments due later in the year., While everything can be found online, the library is a great resource to help streamline your research. Talk to the librarian to help you find books, papers, or other resources for your assignment., Ask your teacher for helpful study tips. She may give you specific chapters to focus on. Assemble a study group to help support each other and test each other prior to the exam. Studying early lets you find the most effective study method that works for you., School should not feel like a chore. A happy and productive student is a great addition to any classroom. Your teacher will appreciate you if you brighten up her day with your enthusiasm and attitude., School can be stressful so join a club, sports team, or simply participate in activities like free movie nights to give yourself some relief from stress. Check your school paper or community bulletin board for activities or clubs that you can join.Becoming a well-rounded student also helps with job and college applications as well as helps with social skills.

, Whether you have a job or are in a club, you should not neglect your studies. Extracurricular activities are meant to round your out as a person. Make sure you prioritize your schedule.If you have a goal to save money with your job, make sure you can handle your workload and don’t over commit. While money is a great incentive for hard work, it is short-sighted to place material possessions over education.

, It’s difficult to get along with everyone all the time. Your teacher is a person with a unique personality. Learning to get along with different people is an important life skill. Learn more about your teacher until you find some common ground and work from there.No matter what your life goals are, you will always encounter people that you don’t completely get along with. Learning how to relate to your teacher can be invaluable moving forward. For example, ask about where your teacher grew up or what hobbies he likes. He may surprise with similar music tastes or similar religious background.

, Any relationship needs respect so don’t expect to have a good relationship with your teacher without showing her respect first. Be polite and courteous even if you don’t agree with your teacher’s opinion. Be a responsible student and let your teacher know when you need to miss class or when you will make up for a late assignment.Don’t think your time is more important than any other student’s. Showing initiative and being responsible for yourself is a great way to keep your teacher’s respect and keep you in high regard.

, Teachers will resent you if you are being insincere with your efforts to make a connection. Your teacher will be able to sense if you suddenly change your demeanor after asking for a college reference or a job recommendation., Your classmates will resent you if your actions are phony and your teacher may call you out in front of the entire class if she finds your actions to be too much., There may be rules for your teacher not to accept any gifts but it’s find to show your gratitude if your teacher has helped you. However, if you give him something expensive or flashy, that could send a wrong message and get you in a lot of trouble.It is a teacher’s job to help her students and your education and well-being is reward enough. While material gifts may seem like a good gesture, doing well in school and growing up into a productive member of your community is exactly what your teacher hopes for you.

, You may question a grade or ask to retake a test but don’t do this more than once. If you continually second-guess your teacher, he will see that as disrespectful and come to resent you. If you always knit pick about points for a grade, you may wear your teacher’s patience., Your teacher may be affected by something happening in her personal life. Don’t be quick to judge if your teacher seems to be off. Your teacher may be cranky, irritable or unable to concentrate because of job stress, family problems, or health issues.Conversely, don’t automatically assume your teacher is going through personal issues. Your teacher may become offended if you make false accusations.

, If you constantly butt heads with your teacher, keep in mind your permanent record will reflect all the disciplinary action that you have received. This may make it extremely difficult to get into college or get a job., Talking while the teacher is talking can be very disruptive. In contrast, sleeping, doodling, or text messaging can also be distracting and is very disrespectful to your teacher. When you do participate in class don’t be rude or try to be the class clown.There’s a difference between participation and being obnoxious. While making your classmates laugh may be fun, there is an appropriate time and place., Let her know why you feel your relationship is strained. For example say something like, “I feel embarrassed when it’s like you're trying to single me out"" or ""I feel like you only ask the same people to volunteer."" Try to work together to find a solution., If you don’t mesh with your teacher’s personality, get to know her and what she is knowledgeable about so that you find some common ground. There is a part of your teacher’s personality that you can use as a tool to help you learn. You will strengthen your relationship with her as you try to find that part of her personality., Perhaps this isn’t just an isolated incident. Talk to your peers and ask them for tips, tools, and create a plan to get along with your teacher. Sharing notes can help you get support and another perspective on how to understand a subject.If you’re too shy to talk to your classmates, watch what the successful ones do and try to mimic their actions. You’ll find that a lot of them ask a lot of questions and frequently participate in class.

, If you have exhausted all your resources and made a genuine effort to build a relationship with your teacher, ask your school guidance counselor or vice principal for help. They may be able to offer tips or act as mediator to help you and your teacher come up with a solution., Let your parents or guardians know that you are having problems getting along with your teacher. Let them know why you think your relationship is strained and what you have done to try to rectify it. Your parents or guardian may be able to meet with your teacher and better express how you’re feeling., If you encounter and physical or verbal abuse, like racist or sexual comments, report it immediately to your principal, parents, and even police. If your teacher is making you uncomfortable in any way you do not need to put up with it.Don’t keep your safety and well-being at risk or the safety and well-being of other students at risk by remaining silent. Your teacher should not be abusing his position so don’t feel intimidated or scared. Your principal, other teachers, and parents will all all put an immediate stop to inappropriate behaviour and you won’t have to deal with your teacher again.

"Federalist #39 (the series of letters written by the authors of the Constitution wherein they told us what it means) is very clear about why the Electoral college exists, and it isn't about ""communications difficulties"" or ""the people are too stupid to directly elect a President"" 

They did it this way because they did a thorough study of the history of civilizations and discovered the both democracy and federalist governments have inherent flaws that tend to cause the society to collapse into despotism. The looked a Greek, Roman, and Lycean democracies, Germany Federal Republic, and others. The first 3 Federalist Papers are little more than a history lesson, and fascinating. 

Our system of government is crafted to avoid those inherent flaws by combining some parts of democracy (the House of Representatives, every citizen has an equal say therefore populous states have greater sway) with some parts of a Republic (the Senate, every state has an equal say regardless of population). The electoral college is the combination of those two ideas, neither wholly democratic nor wholly federal, but a combination of the two that overcomes the weaknesses of each."	0
"  Recent observations suggest that global properties of the host galaxies for
long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are particularly well-suited for creating
the massive star progenitors of these GRBs. Motivated by the hypothesis that
massive young star clusters located in metal-poor, low-metallicity galaxies are
a natural birthsite for GRB progenitors, we present a comparison study of the
ISM properties along the sightline toward the super star cluster, NGC1705-1,
and those in distant GRB hosts. Using the same set of metal transitions in the
UV and applying known ISM structures in NGC1705, we find that NGC1705-1
resembles distant GRB host galaxies in its high neutral gas column, low
molecular gas fraction, low metallicity, alpha-element enhancement,and low dust
depletion. The lack of molecular gas is due to the enhanced UV radiation field
in the starburst environment, consistent with the expectations for GRB
progenitors. In addition, the known presence of dense neutral gas clouds at
r<500 pc from NGC1705-1 provides a natural reservoir of C^+, Si^+, and Fe^+
ions that may be subsequently excited by the afterglow UV radiation field to
produce excited lines commonly seen in GRB host ISM. We further argue that the
apparent offset in the velocity profiles of low- and high-ionization
transitions from absorption-line observations alone already offers important
clues for related starburst episodes in GRB host galaxies. Our study shows that
a statistical comparison between the ISM around star clusters and high-redshift
GRB progenitors is important for identifying the key physical parameters that
facilitate the formation of GRBs.

The airplanes are too small to disturb them much. The planes have wings that create lift and drag forces on their way up or down through the atmosphere of Earth.  Lift is created when an airplane flies faster than its surrounding air (relative wind). Drag occurs because the wing creates friction with the air as it moves forward.   Airplanes fly at high speeds so they can get enough lift from the wings to overcome gravity.    When you see clouds moving in front of your plane during takeoff/landing it's probably due to turbulence caused by the wake vortex behind the aircraft. Wake vortices occur after the main body of the jet engine has passed over the wingtip creating a low pressure area which sucks the surrounding air into itself causing swirling winds around the tail section of the aircraft.     This happens more often if there isn't any other traffic near you but usually dissipates within seconds once you've left the airport runway	1

"The 37th Army was an Army-level formation of the Soviet Union during the Second World War. The army was formed twice during the war.  The army was part of the Southern Group of Forces in Romania and Bulgaria.

First formation
The 37th Army first formed on 10 August 1941 in the Southwestern Front with the command group from the Kiev Fortified Region and other reserves in front reserves.

Upon formation the army took up defensive positions to the west of Kiev and on the left bank of the Dnieper River. During the defense of Kiev the army suffered serious losses against superior German forces. The army was surrounded in the city of Kiev and was ordered to break out on 19 September. Individual units of the army were able to break out and joined forces with the front. Many of the other units of the army were destroyed. The army was disbanded on 25 September 1941.

295th Rifle Division
Artillery and other units.

Second Formation
The army was reformed on 15 November 1941 in the Southern Front for a counterattack in the Rostov area against the German 1st Panzer Army. These actions facilitated the 9th and 56th Armies liberation of Rostov-on-Don.  The army took part in the Barvenkovo-Lozovaya Offensive from 18–31 January 1942 with the goal of destroying the German Army in southern Ukraine.

The army conducted defensive operations during the summer and fall of 1942 in reaction to German operations in the Southern Soviet Union.  The army was transferred from the Southern Front to the Don Group of the North Caucasian Front (I Formation) in late July and then the  Transcaucasian Front in August 1942.

As part of the North Caucasian Strategic Offensive in January 1943 the army liberated the towns of Kislovodsk, Pyatigorsk, Essentuki and Cherkessk.  The army was transferred to the North Caucasian Front(II Formation) on 24 January to participate in the Krasnodar Offensive.  In July the army forces were reassigned to the 9th and 56th Armies and the 37th Army was placed under STAVKA control.

On 7 September 1943 the army was assigned to the Steppe Front.  The army took part in the liberation of the Left-bank Ukraine east of Kremenchug.  In late September it crossed the Dnieper River west of Keleberda and northwest of Mishurin Rog.  From October to December the army was involved in offensive operations in the Krivoy Rog area.

Assigned to the 3rd Ukrainian Front on 15 January 1944.  Participated in the Odessa Offensive in conjunction with the 46th Army.  From 8 August, the army participated in the Jassy–Kishinev Offensive and in September the liberation of Bulgaria. By the end of September, its troops reached the area of Kazanlak, Yambol, and Burgas, where the army's combat history ended. The army remained in Bulgaria as a garrison for the rest of the war, and was redesignated the 37th Separate Army on 15 December.

Composition
The army had the following units assigned when formed:
51st Rifle Division
96th Rifle Division
99th Rifle Division
216th Rifle Division
253rd Rifle Division
295th Rifle Division

Forces assigned on 7 September 1943 upon attachment to the Steppe Front:
57th Rifle Corps
82nd Rifle Corps
53rd Rifle Division

Forces assigned at the end of the war.
34th Rifle Corps
259th Rifle Division
353rd Rifle Division
394th Rifle Division
66th Rifle Corps
195th Rifle Division
244th Rifle Division

82nd Rifle Corps
28th Guards Rifle Division
92nd Guards Rifle Division
188th Rifle Division
255th Naval Rifle Brigade
35th Antiaircraft Artillery Division
Artillery, tank and engineer units.

Post-war
The army was stationed in Bulgaria with its headquarters at Sofia as part of the Southern Group of Forces from 10 June 1945. It was redesignated as the 10th Mechanized Army on 10 June 1946, and included four divisions: the 2nd Guards, 4th Guards, 19th, and 21st Mechanized Divisions. The 2nd Guards Mechanized Division at Craiova was the former 2nd Guards Mechanized Corps, the 4th Guards Mechanized Division at Sofia was the former 4th Guards Mechanized Corps, the 19th Mechanized Division at Plovdiv was the former 244th Rifle Division, and the 21st Mechanized Division at Burgas was the former 223rd Rifle Division. In July, the 21st Mechanized was withdrawn to the Soviet Union, leaving the army with only three divisions. The army was disbanded on 15 June 1947, along with its 19th Mechanized Division, after the signing of the peace treaties with Romania and Bulgaria.

Commanders
The army's first formation was commanded by the following officer:
Major General Andrey Vlasov (July–September 1941)

The army's second formation was commanded by the following officers:
Major General (Promoted to Lieutenant General March 1942) Anton Lopatin (October 1941 – June 1942)

"The Parola Tank Museum is located in the village of San Giorgio Canavese, Piedmont Region (Italy). It houses one of the largest collections of tanks and armoured vehicles from World War II on display outside Europe or North America.
History

In 1937, during the Spanish Civil War, Antonio Parola was commissioned by General Francisco Franco to build several tank prototypes based upon his designs.  The first prototype was completed at the end of 1938 but it did not enter service until 1940 when Spain entered into conflict against France.   During this time period he also designed other types of military equipment including aircraft engines.    After the war ended,  Antonio Parola returned home where he continued working as a designer and builder of heavy machinery such as cranes and excavators.   In 1947  he founded the company that bears his name which still operates today under its original family ownership.   He died in 1968 leaving behind a large collection of tanks and armored fighting vehicles collected over many years.   His son Gianni took charge of running the business while continuing collecting more tanks and armored vehicles.   Today there are approximately 150 tanks displayed inside the museum along with numerous other pieces of military hardware dating back to the First World War through to modern times.

, This is your starting position. From here, you can move to cover first or second base, and you're filling the space in between so that you can get any balls hit there.


If you have a left handed batter, take a small step closer to 1st, not more than a few steps though.
If there is a runner on first, step a little to second base. More than likely you will get a throw, and it's faster to run to second when you're closer to the base.

, Prepare for every possible situation. Know where to throw the ball if it comes to you, and what base to cover if it doesn't. Talk to your teammates so that you all know where to play the ball.

, Always know where the runners are. Try to get the lead runner. They have a better chance of scoring, and getting them out first will make it easier to get future runners. If you are not sure where to play, throw to first. That is your best bet.

, This gives you a chance to warn the catcher or the player if the runner tries to steal. This can help them respond faster when the runner starts running.

, Stay on your toes, ready to move any direction at any moment. Always keep an eye on the batter and the ball. Be ready for anything that comes your way.

, Playing is all about having fun. Don't give off negative attitude. It boosts your spirit and friendship with the other team and also makes the rest of the players on yours and the others team happier and spirit lifted. Encourage your teammates and always thank the other team for a good game.

, More than likely you will receive a throw. Don't worry, shortstop will cover your position!

, Shortstop can't cover, so you have to run!

, If you cover first, the catcher,first baseman, or third baseman can throw the ball to you to get the batter out.

, Shortstop can't cover second because the have to back up third base.

, Most of the time shortstop covers second base. If there's nowhere else you're supposed to be, back her up.

, If it is hit far out in left field you cover second base. If it is far out in right field, then you are to run and be the cut off. Short stop will cover second base.

, If there is a runner, they will go on a bad throw from the catcher. If you back up the throw you could possibly throw the runner out.

, You have to remember to watch the runner and back up the throw in case the runner does run to second. Alert the pitcher when they have the ball if the runner on first is attempting to go to second because they may not be paying attention and they could throw it to second or first and possibly get the runner out.

, Just start backing up the pitcher once there is a runner on second.

, In this scenario, you don't have to tag the runner. There will be other events where you have to tag the runner.

, Think of an imaginary line from the pitcher to the actual second base. Don't intrude when a grounder or pop fly is hit to them and they won't intrude when a grounder or pop fly is hit to you.

" The better the grapes, the better the jelly. It doesn't matter if they are seeded or seedless, green, white or red. That said, seeded grapes usually have a stronger flavor, and the majority of jellies are made with red or Concord grapes.You can also use 5 cups of grape juice in a pinch.

, You should have roughly five lbs of grapes to work with.


If you plan on canning all the jelly yourself, start preparing the cans now.


, If you need a little extra to make sure that you have the berries covered, use it.








, Raise the heat and put the cover on, letting the berries boil for ten minutes. Every few minutes give everything a nice big stir.








, Put about 2 cups at a time into the bag and let the juice drain. The jelly bag will collect the pulp, skin, and any seeds while the juice that you will use for the jelly drains out. You should have about 5 cups of juice at the end of this process.








Squeeze the juice through the bag with clean hands or by pressing it gently with a spoon. Empty and discard the pulp periodically if the juice is draining too slowly. Rinse the bag if needed.
If you don't have a jelly bag, try forcing it through a mesh strainer lined with cheese cloth., Get a vigorous, rolling boiling going for about a minute before moving on to the next step..








, Keep the boil going for a quick, hard minute, stirring constantly.








, Move quickly here -- you want the jelly to chill in the jars, not in the pot. Get the foam off with a slotted spoon and move on.









For a little different flavor, consider adding 2-3 tablespoons of lemon juice here, giving your final jelly a bit of tangy-ness., This is why preparing the jars ahead of time is so essential. By letting the mixture cool out in the open, you open the possibility that the jelly will crystallize and turn to a chunky, unappetizing mixture.








Leave roughly 1/4 of an inch between the top of the jar and your fill line., Canning requires you to heat the jars (after the are filled with jelly) to sterilize them and preserve the fruit. You should have your hot water bath boiling at the same time as you jelly.The following method will help you if you do not have dedicated canning equipment. However, getting a canning set is almost always easier than using a homemade water bath.;
, This allows you to work efficiently, as opposed to rushing around as the jelly finishes. If you don't have a dishwasher with a sterilize setting, wash them with soap and water. Then boil the jars for 10 minutes, leaving them in the water until you're ready to use them. The lids should be kept in hot (but not boiling) water for 5-10 minutes.


The jars need to be hot when you pour in the jelly, otherwise they may crack.

, Canning jars have a lid and a ring. The lid needs to have an unbroken rubber seal along the outside edge, and these can only be used once for canning. The rims screw on top of the lid to close the jar completely.








, If you live above 1,000 feet above sea level, let them cook for the full ten minutes. Try to keep at least two inches of water above the top of the cans to speed up the process. Also, make sure that you have a tool capable of safely remove the hot cans from the boiling water before you begin.









If you live above 6,000ft above sea level, you should let the jars boil for closer to 15 minutes., Place the jars in a cool place (not the refrigerator -- that's too cold) and let them cool back to room temperature. After 1-2 hours, when they don't burn you when touched, loosen the rims on the jars a half turn or so to prevent it from rusting or sticking onto the jar.







, It shouldn't easily pop up and down, and shouldn't make a noise when pushed. If it does then you don't have the jar completely sealed, and the preserves will quickly spoil if you're not careful. Properly preserved jelly should last up to 12 months.

"Marco Passionei (13 September 1560 – 30 April 1625) - in religion Benedetto da Urbino - was an Italian Roman Catholic and a professed member from the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin. Passionei was of frail constitution which led to a number of rejections from the order but he was allowed to enter and was later ordained - he served in the missions for a period of time before his death.

Pope Pius IX confirmed his beatification in 1867.

Life
Marco Passionei was born on 13 September 1560 as the seventh of eleven children to the nobles Domenico Passionei and Maddalena Cibo. His parents died sometime in his childhood.

He graduated with a doctorate in both civil and canon law in Padua in 1582 and decided to enter the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin after responding to his religious calling. He first served in Rome to the court of Cardinal Gian Girolamo Albani but realized he did not want to remain there as it did not serve his religious aspirations. Passionei was soon able to admit himself - after several rejections - to the order in Fano at the convent of Santa Caterina despite his fragile health and was placed under the direction of Father Bonaventura; he received the habit on 1 May 1584 and later professed in May 1585. He was forced to leave a few months later and moved to recuperate from stomach ailments in a convent in Fossombrone. Passionei underwent his theological formation under Father Girolamo da Castelferretti.

Passionei was later ordained to the priesthood in 1590 and assumed the religious name of ""Benedetto da Urbino"". He was then sent as part of a team of missionaries in 1600 with Lawrence of Brindisi to Bohemia after Pope Clement VIII ordered that missionaries be sent there to evangelize; he was stationed there until 1603. He often was troubled with leg pains and often fasted in addition to flagellating himself for half an hour and wearing a hairnet; he slept little and often on a wooden plank.

He died on 30 April 1625 after a period of ill health. He went for an operation on a hernia in Lent but his health declined and this led to his death not long after.

Beatification
The sainthood process commenced in Urbino under Pope Innocent XII on 17 September 1796 - it granted him the title of Servant of God. His life of heroic virtue was recognized on 24 February 1798 and allowed for Pope Pius VI to confer upon him the title of Venerable. Pope Pius IX beatified him on 10 February 1867 after the recognition of two miracles attributed to his intercession.

"We present new high-precision photometric observations in BVRI filters obtained with the 1 m telescope at Mt. Wilson Observatory, California, USA during two nights in August 2005. The data were reduced using standard procedures for aperture photometry. We also used previously published spectroscopic data to determine orbital parameters of this system. 
 
 In addition we have performed detailed analysis of all available photometric light curves of V471 Tau covering more than 50 years. Our results show that there is no significant change in the period over time which indicates very low mass transfer rate between components. This conclusion agrees well with our previous estimates based on radial velocity measurements. 
 
 We found that the observed changes in the shape of the eclipse profiles are caused by ellipsoidal deformation of the secondary component due to tidal forces acting upon it as a result of its close proximity to the primary white dwarf star. Using these results together with those derived from the spectral disentangling technique applied to the composite spectrum of the system we determined masses of both stars - 0.6 M☉ for the white dwarf and 0.3 M☉ for the red dwarf companion."	1
"Illegal acts are punishable by law, while unconstitutional ones aren't necessarily so. The Constitution does not specify penalties or consequences of breaking it (except in cases where there has been an amendment). Illegal actions can be punished with fines and/or jail time depending on what they were; however, impeachment proceedings cannot result from illegal acts but only those that violate constitutional rights. Unconstitutionality refers to whether or not certain laws comply with the constitution's rules regarding how government should operate.  For example, if President Trump fired FBI Director James Comey without cause he would have done something unconstitutional because firing someone who was leading an investigation into you as head of state violates your Constitutional right against self-incrimination.   If Donald Trump had committed treason during his presidency then this act could also be considered illegal/unconstitutional since treason is defined under federal law as being ""the levying war against [the United States]..."	1
Celebrity status is not protected under privacy laws like other people's private lives are. Celebrities have no legal protection from being photographed or filmed without consent while ordinary citizens do. This means that if you don't want your picture taken then it doesn't matter how famous you are:  nobody can take pictures of you unless they get permission first (or break into your house). If you're an average person who wants some privacy when it comes to having your photo taken - it's illegal for anyone else to publish those images without your permission.  However,  celebs aren't legally entitled to any such rights so they're constantly violated with impunity.   The only way around this would be to sue every single publication which uses these photographs and hope they'd pay up enough money to make it worthwhile. Because most publications won't even acknowledge they've used them anyway! It's also important to note here that there isn't really anything stopping someone taking a photo of a celebrity's home life as long as they haven't broken into his/her property illegally	1
"  We analyze a recently proposed method to create fractional quantum Hall (FQH)
states of atoms confined in optical lattices [A. S{\o}rensen {\it et al.},
Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 94} 086803 (2005)]. Extending the previous work, we
investigate conditions under which the FQH effect can be achieved for bosons on
a lattice with an effective magnetic field and finite onsite interaction.
Furthermore, we characterize the ground state in such systems by calculating
Chern numbers which can provide direct signatures of topological order and
explore regimes where the characterization in terms of wavefunction overlap
fails. We also discuss various issues which are relevant for the practical
realization of such FQH states with ultracold atoms in an optical lattice,
including the presence of the long-range dipole interaction which can improve
the energy gap and stabilize the ground state. We also investigate a new
detection technique based on Bragg spectroscopy to probe these system in an
experimental realization.

"Specifically, this paper suggests regularizing the estimator of a probability distribution to prefer high-entropy distributions.  This avoids overfitting.

I generally like this idea.  Regularizing the behavior of the model often makes more sense than regularizing its parameters.  After all, the behavior is interpretable, whereas the parameters are uninterpretable and work together in mysterious ways to produce the behavior.  So one might be able to choose a more sensible prior over the behavior.  In other words, prefer parameters not because they are individually close to 0 but because they jointly lead to a distribution that is plausible or low-risk a priori.

Pro: I believe that the idea is natural and sound (that is, I do not share the doubts of AnonReviewer5).

Pro: It's possible that this hasn't been well-explored yet in neural networks (not sure).

Pro: The experimental results look good.  So maybe everyone should use this kind of regularizer. 

Con: It is a kind of pollution of the scientific literature to introduce this idea to the community as if it were unconnected to (almost) anything else in machine learning.  There are many, many papers that include a scaled entropy term in the optimization objective!  It's not just for reinforcement learning.  Please see the long list of connections in my pre-review questions / comments.  

Con: Experimental results should always be accompanied by significance tests and error analysis.  Is your trained model actually doing better on the distribution of test data, or was your test set too small to tell?  Are the improvements robust across many different training sets?  What errors does your model fix, and what errors does it introduce?  

Summary recommendation: Revise and resubmit.  ICLR has lots of submissions.  I would prefer to reward authors who not only tried something, but who properly contextualized it and carefully evaluated it.  Otherwise, there's a race to the bottom where everyone wants to be the first to try something, so that readers are confronted with a confusing sea of slapdash papers with unclear relationships."	0

"We present an optimal algorithm for generating pointed trivalent diagrams, which are combinatorial objects that encode the topology of 3-manifolds. The algorithm is based on a new concept called ""triangulation by flipping"", in which we flip edges of a triangulated surface until it becomes minimal with respect to some criterion. We show how this can be used to generate all possible pointed trivalent diagrams associated to any given triangulated surface. As applications, we give algorithms for computing the Heegaard genus of closed orientable 3-manifolds and for enumerating all prime factorizations of integers into primes less than or equal to n{\displaystyle n}. In addition, we provide an efficient method for counting the number of pointed triangular maps (a subclass of pointed trivalent diagrams) up to isotopy. This work was supported by NSF grant DMS-0805040. 1 Introduction Let M be a compact connected oriented 3-manifold whose boundary consists of tori. A Heegaard splitting of M is a decomposition of M into two handlebodies V and W such that their common boundary is homeomorphic to M. It follows immediately from the definition that every closed orientable 3-manfiold admits at least one Heegaard splitting. However, there exist manifolds that admit more than one Heegaard splitting; these manifolds are said to have multiple Heegaard splittings. For example, if S is a sphere with three holes then S×S has four different Heegaard splitttings [O] ."	1

"It honestly probably has more to do with how we're socialized into music.  The trope of minor being used for sad things and major being used for happy things is sort of an artificially created thing to an extent.

**Things below get a little ELI20:**

In fact, not even all very young school children will agree about this until we tell them so (my wife used to teach elementary music).  Other cultures with less overbearing exposure to Western music are even less likely to always correctly identify these.

To get more complicated, if you look into Arabic maqams (essentially scales for the sake of simplicity) they sound quite different with a bit more microtonality compared to Western ideas of tuning and such.  The thing is, when we hear them, they all just sound semi-foreign.  The ones that sound most like a major scale or maybe a lydian scale sound happier to us.  The ones closer to a minor or locrian scale sound sadder.

But in the cultures to which these are native, the great variety of maqams hold much more subtley of meaning and even the ones we might equate with sadness are not thought of as such where they are actually commonly used.

**Below we go into ELI have a basic understanding of theory:**

So major and minor are very black and white for us, but if you just wanna talk about chords, what about bigger chords?  Start with something like a CMaj7.  It's a C on the bottom with an Em on the top.  Does it sound happy or sad?  Are you hearing the C major of the primary triad, or the minor triad when ignoring the root?  You can obviously grow this idea out like crazy.  A Cm9... what do you hear?  The EbMaj7 ignoring the root?  The Eb major chord in the middle ignoring root and 9?  The Gm on top?  The Cm on bottom?

Is this a happy or sad sounding chord?  I think most people would call it ""dreamy, sleepy, or ethereal,"" but once again, that's likely more to do with how we most often hear it used.

Also, context counts.  You can revoice a complicated chord for a different sound.  But you can also revoice a simple chord and depending on the context and character of the piece, it might throw you off.  Have you ever been listening to something and couldn't quite tell if a given chord was major or minor in context on the fly?  What if you have a C major triad and suddenly the bass moves away from the C up to E and the E and G are sustained in the upper voice.  Is this implying an Em without the 5th?  Is it still implying the C major but in root position?  You probably need context to tell you.

How about a C7.  This one is great for context.  Do you hear the Edim or the C major?  Or hell, do you just hear it as a dominant chord because it's followed by an F or even Dm?



TL;DR - Because someone told you so.

EDIT regarding my thoughts on the ""natural"" majorness and happiness of the harmonic series:
 I seem to be the minority by not just writing it off as the natural overtone thing.  That said, it still doesn't account for the difference in social interpretations of given tonalities to cultures that aren't brought up in the Western music tradition or the fact that not all children immediately adopt the happy/sad dichotomy until they are told to feel that way.  While the harmonic series does have a sort of natural elegance to it, I really don't think it explains this away.  Hindemith covered this extensively and he based his whole idea of composition essentially around the idea of a very extended view into the harmonic series, but honestly, what we think of as pure sounds break down a little ways in.  Certain harmonics are frighteningly out of line, though we're less able to hear them normally.  

Also, we commonly bastardize this absolutely pure version of the harmonic series with equal temperament anyway, so the only place you'll hear good, adjusted, clean temperaments that make the harmonic series work the best is with a capella groups or very very talented chamber ensembles that have no fixed pitch instruments (basically any keyboard or harp type instruments).  These groups will naturally tune as they go to make every spot as pitch perfect as possible.  Meaning, A440 might not be 440 if it's the third of an F major chord versus being the root of another chord.

"We present new HST photometric data on halo stars in the nearby elliptical galaxy NGC 3377, obtained with the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2). The observations were made as part of program GO-8491 and consist of two exposures taken through the F606W filter at different roll angles to allow for proper sky subtraction. We have used these images to measure magnitudes for more than 1000 candidate red giant branch (RGB) stars within an area of 1 arcmin radius centered around the galaxy's center. These measurements are compared to those derived by Kundu & Whitmore (1998) , who observed this same field using ground-based telescopes. Our results show good agreement between our photometry and that presented previously; however we find evidence for systematic differences which may be due to crowding effects or calibration uncertainties.

"We introduce the concept of brane tilings, which are generalizations of tiling groups and can be used to describe many different types of physical systems in terms of their symmetries.  We show that any finite group is isomorphic to some brane tiling group (Theorem 1). In particular, we prove that all Coxeter groups are brane tiling groups (Corollary 2), as well as all Artin groups with torsion-free abelian subgroups (Corollary 3).  As an application, we give a new proof for the classification theorem of finite simple groups by showing how they arise naturally through the action of brane tilings on surfaces (Theorem 4).
Introduction

Tilings have been studied extensively over the past few decades due to their connections to various branches of mathematics such as number theory, combinatorics, geometry, and physics.   The most famous example of this connection comes from the work of Roger Penrose [Pen91] , who showed that certain patterns observed in nature could be described using tiles whose sides were straight lines but had angles of 60 degrees or 120 degrees instead of 90 degrees.   These so-called ""non-standard"" tilings are now known as Penrose tilings.    Another important class of non-standard tilings was introduced by Thurston [Tho93] .    He constructed examples of tilings where each tile has four sides, two of them being parallel to one another while the other two form a pair of perpendicular bisectors.   This type of tiling is called a quadrilateral tiling.   It turns out that these tilings also appear frequently in nature;  for instance, they occur in quasicrystals, which are materials made up of atoms arranged into periodic structures that do not fit exactly within standard unit cells.   A third class of non-standard tilers was discovered independently by Conway and Lagarias [CL95] and by Wang [Wan96] .

"This paper considers an alternate formulation of Kernel PCA with rank constraints incorporated as a regularization term in the objective. The writing is not clear. The focus keeps shifting from estimating “causal factors”, to nonlinear dimensionality reduction to Kernel PCA to ill-posed inverse problems. The problem reformulation of Kernel PCA uses somewhat standard tricks and it is not clear what are the advantages of the proposed approach over the existing methods as there is no theoretical analysis of the overall approach or empirical comparison with existing state-of-the-art.  

- Not sure what the authors mean by “causal factors”. There is a reference to it in Abstract and in Problem formulation on page 3 without any definition/discussion.

- In KPCA, I am not sure why one is interested in step (iii) outlined on page 2 of finding a pre-image for each

- Authors outline two key disadvantages of the existing KPCA approach. The first one, that of low-dimensional manifold assumption not holding exactly, has received lots of attention in the machine learning literature. It is common to assume that the data lies near a low-dimensional manifold rather than on a low-dimensional manifold. Second disadvantage is somewhat unclear as finding “a data point (pre-image) corresponding to each projection in the input space” is not a standard step in KPCA. 

- On page 3, you never define $\mathcal{X} \times N$, $\mathcal{Y} \times N$, $\mathcal{H} \times N$. Clearly, they cannot be cartesian products. I have to assume that notation somehow implies N-tuples. 

- On page 3, Section 2, $\mathcal{X}$ and $\mathcal{Y}$ are sets. What do you mean by $\mathcal{Y} \ll \mathcal{X}$

- On page 5, $\mathcal{S}^n$ is never defined. 

- Experiments: None of the standard algorithms for matrix completion such as OptSpace or SVT were considered 

- Experiments: There is no comparison with alternate existing approaches for Non-rigid structure from motion.  

- Proof of the main result Theorem 3.1: To get from (16) to (17) using the Holder inequality (as stated) one would end up with a term that involves sum of fourth powers of weights w_{ij}.

The contraction ends when the chemical are cleared away stopping the reaction. A ""knot"" in a muscle is an area of muscle fibre that has remained contracted while the rest of the muscle has relaxed. By pressing on the knot for an extended period of time (technical term is digital ischemic pressure) the blood in the area is forced away. When you then lift off, fresh blood floods in and this helps to clear away the remaining chemicals that were still bound to the muscle fibres, allowing them to relax.

Edit: Looking through the comments there are 3 main ideas being thrown around, and I had addressed 2 of them in comments so I thought I should put the info here too.

Good news is, all 3 ideas are relevant. I provided the answer above As my primary response as it relates directly to the question of pushing into the muscle, but as a remedial therapist treating soft tissues, a combinations of techniques are needed for effective treatment. 

Stimulation of the Golgi tendon organ is one of those treatments and is used mostly on long muscles, like calves and hamstrings, when tension is being felt along the length of the whole muscles as opposed to an isolated area of contraction ""knot"". Most effective way of stimulating the Golgi organ is by bowing the tendon as this effectively makes it freak out thinking the tendon is about to snap, telling the muscle it has to relax so this doesn't happen.

Adhesions are another issue where trauma to the muscle fibres over react while healing causing them to become stuck to the fascia  (muscle casing), this results in the muscles not being able to move smoothly and will cause disfunction of movements. This is commonly treated with friction as it helps to tear apart the adhesions."	0
"  (Abridged) We have obtained radial velocities of a sample of 18 ultracool
dwarfs (M6.5-T8) using high-resolution, near-infrared spectra obtained with
NIRSPEC and the Keck II telescope. We have confirmed that the radial velocity
of Gl 570 D is coincident with that of the K-type primary star Gl 570 A, thus
providing additional support for their true companionship. The presence of
planetary-mass companions around 2MASS J05591914-1404488 (T4.5V) has been
analyzed using five NIRSPEC radial velocity measurements obtained over a period
of 4.37 yr. We have computed UVW space motions for a total of 21 L and T dwarfs
within 20 pc of the Sun. This population shows UVW velocities that nicely
overlap the typical kinematics of solar to M-type stars within the same spatial
volume. However, the mean Galactic (44.2 km/s) and tangential (36.5 km/s)
velocities of the L and T dwarfs appear to be smaller than those of G to M
stars. A significant fraction (~40%) of the L and T dwarfs lies near the Hyades
moving group (0.4-2 Gyr), which contrasts with the 10-12% found for
earlier-type stellar neighbors. Additionally, the distributions of all three
UVW components (sigma_{UVW} = 30.2, 16.5, 15.8 km/s) and the distributions of
the total Galactic (sigma_{v_tot} = 19.1 km/s) and tangential (sigma_{v_t} =
17.6 km/s) velocities derived for the L and T dwarf sample are narrower than
those measured for nearby G, K, and M-type stars, but similar to the
dispersions obtained for F stars. This suggests that, in the solar
neighborhood, the L- and T-type ultracool dwarfs in our sample (including brown
dwarfs) is kinematically younger than solar-type to early M stars with likely
ages in the interval 0.5-4 Gyr.

"The authors propose an interesting approach for learning how to split sentences into sub-sentences using neural networks.  They show promising results when applied to text-to-text translation tasks but it remains unclear whether their method would work well if used directly on raw audio signals instead of transcribed texts. 
Strengths: 
This research has potential applications beyond just machine translation problems. 

Weaknesses: 

It might also help improve other types of NLP systems such as language understanding engines.  

In addition, there are some minor issues regarding the presentation style of the manuscript itself.   For example,  I think it's important  to clearly state at least one concrete application where your proposed solution could have practical value.    Also,   you should try to make sure all figures look consistent across different pages so they don't appear out of place once printed."	1
", (And, it helps if you understand at least the basic chords and some music theory for harmony, etc.)

, You have to make the chords fit the melody notes -- not the other way around. Try to avoid clashing notes. There are several ways to do this. If the song has a ""left hand"" look in it, and if the structure isn't too complicated, listen to the section you're putting a chord into and decide if it is major or minor.

, Unless the song is really complicated, one of those should fit. By simply analyzing the section in which you're placing a chord, the tonic (first note, I) of the melody chord/key will usually be seen here and there in the bar(s) of the melody where you are looking to fit your chord.

, For the minor scales the roman numerals for chords are lowercase i-iv-v: that's the tonic(i) sub-dominant(iv) and dominant(v)... Write these down somewhere so you can refer to them, because they will come up a lot in theory of harmony!

, You can start by using chords I and V (first and fifth) ""of the scale of the key"" are very commonly used. So the 1st chord of the scale for the key C Major is the tonic (I) ""C Major"" chord (C-E-G) and then chord ""(V) is G Major"" (G-B-D) and so use whichever sounds better in progressions upward and downward in different parts of the song...

,


Just repeat these chords to the beat if you're not sure, and write down the one that sounds the nicest. Don't be afraid to mix them around if you find another chord sounds nicer!

, The chord is highly dependent on which melody notes are being used in that part of the song. So an understanding of theory is helpful -- if for example: the notes of the melody are in the key of C (C-E-G) then you have the sub-dominant ""4th chord (F)"" which fits right in, or chord the ""fifth chord (G)"", and of course ""B (the VII)"" may work as it closely relates to ""G7"", and naturally D, F chords may be comfortable, all being in, of or near C Major.

, Thus, depending on what notes are used like high notes ""G or A"" in the melody then the second inversion of the C chord could accompany this group.

, If, however, the higher notes (E, F, or sometimes G) are used, the first inversion of C would be played to give a different tonality.

, Many a musician can play in a rhythm section -- does not read much music -- but learns and plays harmony to the melody by blending among other instrumentalists by ear (improvising).


The notes of the melody are not the first consideration for strumming, picking, and arpeggio piano chording kind of musician... who is in key and harmonizes to the key, but is not really ""clued"" to knowing the exact melody line or harmony theory...

One may be a good recording session player or band member par excellence by knowing chords inside and out without reading the sheet music, ie: for purposes of commercial/professional entertainment or church music!



, This allows playing chords in any key as the tonic to a melody and to allow easy key changes by counting up and down by musical steps and 1/2 steps (sharps and flats)...

"While the Sun's color spectrum differs from artificial lights, this is not the reason this is difficult. Any light made for film making combined with the correct white balance takes care of this 100%. Incandescent bulbs cover the entire visible spectrum, only in different ratios than the sun. With the correct gel or white balance, these ratios can be brought back to natural levels.

The issue here is **distance**. Light, like many other things, follows the **[inverse square law](_URL_0_)**, which means that the further a light source is, the less difference it makes if you move closer or further from it.

In other words, sunlight hitting your house is the same intensity than sunlight hitting your neighbor's house. Or sunlight hitting your face will be the same intensity as light hitting your hand. With an artificial light, the two won't receive the same amount of light, as the closeness of the light source means the light decays much faster.

We have come to associate one with natural, and the other with artificial light. Even without thinking, we can ""tell"" that light that decays over a short distance is artificial, while light that doesn't decay is natural.

An artificial light source can never be as far away as the Sun for obvious reasons, so another issue is that its shadows will never appear parallel.

The solution is to put your light source very far away, but then you need a light source that's very very strong to compensate. This makes this type of lighting expensive, heavy and time consuming to set up.

Another issue is diffusion. The Sun is surrounded by the sky, from our point of view. The sky is a giant surface very very far away. This means the Sun is accompanied by a fill light of a huge surface that is equally very far away, which is even more difficult to match with artificial light. There is no way we can build a surface anywhere near as large as the sky, and as far away.

To light a single face you may need two giant white sheets suspended with tripods and weights, and four 5 kilowatt lights to light it. Then you need to put all this as far as you can, and hope that enough light still hits your subject. If done right, you won't be able to tell it apart from natural light. Beyond a certain point, our minds won't know the difference."	0
"This paper conducts a comprehensive series of experiments on vocabulary selection strategies to reduce the computational cost of neural machine translation.

A range of techniques are investigated, ranging from very simple methods such as word co-occurences, to the relatively complex use of SVMs.

The experiments are solid, comprehensive and very useful in practical terms.  It is good to see that the best vocabulary selection method is very effective at achieving a very high proportion of the coverage of the full-vocabulary model (fig 3).  However, I feel that the experiments in section 4.3 (vocabulary selection during training) was rather limited in their scope - I would have liked to see more experiments here.

A major criticism I have with this paper is that there is little novelty here.  The techniques are mostly standard methods and rather simple, and in particular, there it seems that there is not much additional material beyond the work of Mi et al (2016).  So although the work is solid, the lack of originality lets it down.

Minor comments: in 2.1, the word co-occurence measure - was any smoothing used to make this measure more robust to low counts?

"  Since first observed in the early 1980s, the Hopkins Phoenix Observatory
continues its UBV band observations of the long period (27.1 years) eclipsing
binary star system epsilon Aurigae. The UBV observations routinely produce
standard deviations or data spread better than 0.01 magnitudes many times
approaching 0.001 magnitudes. A new infrared photometer has allowed the
addition of near-infrared observations for the JH bands. Typical near-infrared
observations approach a standard deviation of data spread of 0.01 magnitudes.
The 2003 - 2005 seasons (Fall through Spring) of epsilon Aurigae observations
showed a 66.2 day variation that gradually increases in average and peak
magnitude in the UBV bands. The 2006 season (Fall 2006 to Spring 2007) data
show what appears to be a fall-back to a quiet period near maximum amplitude of
V= 3.00. This paper presents the data and compares the current season to the
past several seasons. The next eclipse is predicted to begin in 2009 and an
international campaign has been organized to coordinate new observations. These

" Sprint drills are an easy way to accomplish this.


Run at top speed for 20-30 meters.
Make sure that your arm action is smooth and relaxed during the exercise. Keep your arms close to your body.Focus on making smooth, even strides, with your knees high.
Keep your head relaxed and in a natural position.
Slow jog or walk back to your starting point when finished with the sprint.
Do 2-4 repetitions of this drill.;
, Acceleration drills will make you build up to and come down from high speeds more efficiently. This type of exercise also helps you work high speeds into other routines. To do a simple acceleration drill:


Jog for 10 yards.
Sprint for 10 yards.
Shift back to jogging for 10 more yards.
Shift back to sprinting for 10 more yards.
Breakdown in 5 yards.
Walk back to your starting point.

, This horizontal tool requires you to alternate your feet across successive rungs as you run. To improve your speed, train with the ladder while using a stopwatch, and work on improving your best time.


Speed ladders are available at many athletic supply stores.

, To accomplish this, do 30 minutes of interval training. Alternate light jogging (5-10 min) with short bursts of more powerful exercises, such as:


Sprints
Running stairs or hills
Ladder drills
Using a ball in combination with any of the above

, To improve your reaction speed, practice while a coach or friend calls (or better, uses a visual signal) for you to change your exercise. Respond as quickly as possible. Try incorporating a combination of exercises like:


Changing direction rapidly when running
Sprinting on command
Playing “Red Light Green Light”


, To accelerate, you will have to extend and use your hip, knees, and ankles.When running or doing other exercises, focus on making long, even strides that stretch out. Increasing your stride length and muscle output in this way will boost your speed.

, While training to increase your speed at moving across the field, do not neglect your control of the ball. Remember that soccer is primarily a sport where the player’s lower body moves in contact with the ground and ball. To be not only fast, but fast and in control of the ball, you must work on your agility.


Dribble at every opportunity, using all parts of your foot (outside, inside, top, and bottom).Do speed dribbling exercises by kicking the ball slightly forward and running after it.
Practice changing direction quickly while dribbling and doing speed dribbling exercises. You can also do this while attempting to evade another player in order to practice using quick dribbles as a way to beat opponents.
Do lateral ball drop exercises. Have a coach or partner hold a ball at shoulder height, 5 meters away from you. When your coach/partner drops the ball, attempt to reach and control the ball before it bounces a second time.

, Always do stretches and short exercises to warm up before beginning a speed training session.This will prepare your mind and body. If you do not properly warm up, you risk injuring yourself.

, Since it utilizes great power and force, you should do speed exercises while you are still fresh. Otherwise, you might not be able to reach and push your speed potential.

, In addition to exercises that aim to improve your time, try doing plyometric (explosive) exercises and weight training, such as:


Jumps
Squats
Burpees
Bench press
Lifts
Leg curls

, It is very important that you take a day to rest between practice sessions. If you try to train for speed while you are sore or fatigued, you will be unsuccessful and risk injuring yourself.

, Make sure that you have a fundamental knowledge of and good practice with soccer skills before attempting to increase your speed. Focus on doing things the right way, then on becoming faster at them.

Flushing Your Unit With Vinegar Instead Of Chemicals   Flushing out sediment build-up can be done using either chemicals such as muriatic acid or vinegar which does an excellent job without damaging pipes or plumbing fixtures.  To start the flushing process open both the cold and hot water faucets until they're fully opened.     Then close one of the two faucets completely while leaving the other halfway open.  Make sure there isn't enough pressure coming into the closed faucet to cause water damage if there's no water flowing out of the open faucet.     After closing 1 of the 2 faucets attach a garden hose to the remaining open faucet and run it towards the floor drain.  Keep doing this until the entire amount of water needed to fill up the tank has passed through the drainage line.

"  We present the results of a large-scale survey of neutron(n)-capture elements
in Galactic planetary nebulae (PNe), undertaken to study enrichments from
s-process nucleosynthesis in their progenitor stars. From new K band
observations of over 100 PNe supplemented by data from the literature, we have
detected the emission lines [Kr III] 2.199 and/or [Se IV] 2.287 $\mu$m in 81 of
120 objects. We determine Se and Kr elemental abundances, employing ionization
correction formulae derived in the first paper of this series. We find a
significant range in Se and Kr abundances, from near solar (no enrichment) to
enhanced by >1.0 dex relative to solar, which we interpret as self-enrichment
due to in situ s-process nucleosynthesis. Kr tends to be more strongly enriched
than Se; in 18 objects exhibiting both Se and Kr emission, we find that [Kr/Se]
= 0.5$\pm$0.2.
  Our survey has increased the number of PNe with n-capture element abundance
determinations by a factor of ten, enabling us for the first time to search for
correlations with other nebular properties. As expected, we find a positive
correlation between s-process enrichments and the C/O ratio. Type I and bipolar
PNe, which arise from intermediate-mass progenitors (>3-4 solar masses),
exhibit little to no s-process enrichments. Finally, PNe with H-deficient
Wolf-Rayet central stars do not exhibit systematically larger s-process
enrichments than objects with H-rich nuclei. Overall, 44% of the PNe in our
sample display significant s-process enrichments (>0.3 dex). Using an empirical
PN luminosity function to correct for incompleteness, we estimate that the true
fraction of s-process enriched Galactic PNe is at least 20%.

"  In this paper we present the observational campaign carried out at ESO NTT
and VLT in April and May 2006 to investigate the nature and the structure of
the Near Earth Object (144898) 2004 VD17. In spite of a great quantity of
dynamical information, according to which it will have a close approach with
the Earth in the next century, the physical properties of this asteroid are
largely unknown. We performed visible and near--infrared photometry and
spectroscopy, as well as polarimetric observations. Polarimetric and
spectroscopic data allowed us to classify 2004 VD17 as an E-type asteroid. A
good agreement was also found with the spectrum of the aubrite meteorite Mayo
Belwa. On the basis of the polarimetric albedo (p_v=0.45) and of photometric
data, we estimated a diameter of about 320 m and a rotational period of about 2
hours. The analysis of the results obtained by our complete survey have shown
that (144898) 2004 VD17 is a peculiar NEO, since it is close to the breakup
limits for fast rotator asteroids, as defined by Pravec and Harris (2000).
These results suggest that a more robust structure must be expected, as a
fractured monolith or a rubble pile in a ""strength regime"" (Holsapple 2002).

Churches have been exempted by law in many countries, including Canada and the United States since 1913 because they were considered to be charitable organizations that provide social services such as education or health care.  In some cases this exemption is limited only to religious schools operated within church buildings (e.g., Catholic elementary school). The tax-exempt status of churches has also been justified on grounds of their role in promoting religion through worshipping activities. They do not pay income tax but may still owe property taxes if they own real estate. Churches have been exempped by law in many countries... Because they were considered to be charity organizations providing social service like education or healthcare. Yes, it does say so right there! No other reason needed. Yes, it says so right there! No need for any more reasons than what you see here. Yes, it says exactly why - it's all explained clearly	1

"Let's analyze this more critically.

First, which professions are critical? We can obviously ignore middle management, and the corner store clerk, but Police, fire, emt's are a given so we'd have to hope that no one decided to steal anything, get in a fight, or set anything on fire.

Next are hospitals. I'm sure that most patients could be stabilized for 24 hours, but there's considerable chance something could become unstable and some people would probably die.

Now lets consider the prison system. It could probably be set up so none of the prisoners would starve, but you give an entire prison 24 hours unsupervised, and I guarantee someone is going to get out of their cell and start a riot.

I see a lot of people mentioning power stations. Most power plants are self sufficient, so probably nothing. They are also designed to fail safe, so you might get a couple of shutdowns, but not much more. Certainly not a catastrophic across the country blackout (again assuming no one purposefully tried to cause one when no one was looking). But what about nuclear? It's true, the older plants could go critical, but again there are many many fail safes and barring something like an earthquake they wont reach critical mass. Also newer nuclear plants, like the ones they put in subs since power plants haven't been built since the 50s, are designed with a negative coefficient of something (forgot the word at the moment), but basically if it starts getting out of control, the reaction actually starts impairing itself.

TL;DR: If you assume no crime, and preparations work perfectly so nothing fails unexpectedly, not a whole lot. Some people in critical condition might die, as well as anyone that had a major accident, but people die all the time. In reality, the simple absence of a police force would probably cause rioting and it's downhill from there, as it has when police forces have gone on strike in the past.

Great question.

Edit: Lots of people in critical condition would die and thanks for the gold."	0
We present new constraints on the merger rate density and mass ratio distribution for luminous red galaxies (LRGs) using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS DR7). We use these results to place limits on the number of massive dark matter haloes that are not associated with LRG hosts in the local universe. The halo occupation model we employ is based upon an extension of the HOD formalism developed by Zheng et al. (2005) , which allows us to simultaneously constrain both the mean occupation function and its scatter at fixed luminosity as well as the fraction of satellite galaxies that have been recently accreted into their host haloes. Our analysis indicates that there exists a significant population of massive haloes that are not occupied by LRGs within our sample volume. This result suggests that either many of the most massive haloes were assembled very early during cosmic history and/or that they contain only low-mass galaxies.	1

Because it is expensive to have these scans performed on everyone, especially when there may be no reason why one should get them in their early life stages. It would also take up too much time if all people over 30 had this test every year as well. The tests can only detect tumors that are large enough to show up clearly with imaging techniques like CT/MRI scanning. If you don't see anything suspicious then there's nothing wrong! This doesn't mean you're not going to develop something later but it's just hard to tell because we can't predict who will go down any particular path. It's better to catch things quickly than never catching them at all though so that's what makes screening important even though some cancers aren't detectable by current technology.

"  We use a semianalytic galaxy catalogue constructed from the Millennium
Simulation to study the satellites of isolated galaxies in the LCDM cosmogony.
This sample (~80,000$ bright primaries, surrounded by ~178,000 satellites)
allows the characterization, with minimal statistical uncertainty, of the
dynamical properties of satellite/primary galaxy systems in a LCDM universe. We
find that, overall, the satellite population traces the dark matter rather
well: its spatial distribution and kinematics may be approximated by an NFW
profile with a mildly anisotropic velocity distribution. Their spatial
distribution is also mildly anisotropic, with a well-defined ``anti-Holmberg''
effect that reflects the misalignment between the major axis and angular
momentum of the host halo. The isolation criteria for our primaries picks not
only galaxies in sparse environments, but also a number of primaries at the
centre of ''fossil'' groups. We find that the abundance and luminosity function
of these unusual systems are in reasonable agreement with the few available
observational constraints. We recover the expected L_{host} \sigma_{sat}^3
relation for LCDM models for truly-isolated primaries. Less strict primary
selection, however, leads to substantial modification of the scaling relation.
Our analysis also highlights a number of difficulties afflicting studies that
rely on blind stacking of satellite systems to constrain the mean halo mass of
the primary galaxies.

"William Augustus Guy (13 June 1810 – 10 September 1885) was a British physician and medical statistician.

Life
He was born in Chichester and educated at Christ's Hospital and Guy's Hospital; he then studied at the University of Heidelberg and the University of Paris before getting a Bachelor of Medicine degree from the University of Cambridge, 1837.

In 1842, he was appointed professor of forensic medicine at King's College London and assistant physician at King's College Hospital, 1842; he was dean of the faculty of medicine, 1846–58. He also served as Medical Superintendent at Millbank Prison from 1859 to 1869, acting as a semi-official government advisor on prison health, diet and hygiene.

He edited the Journal of the Statistical Society of London (now the Royal Statistical Society), 1852–6 and was its president, 1873-5. The Society still presents the Guy Medals (in gold, silver and bronze) in his memory.

He was vice-president of the Royal Society, 1876–7, and Croonian (1860) and Lumleian (1868) lecturer, and Harveian (1875) orator at the Royal College of Physicians.

He was a founder of the Health of Towns Association and a member of the Commission on Penal Servitude and Criminal Lunacy.

Works
Guy's Principles of Forensic Medicine, first published in 1844, became a standard work; the fourth and later editions were edited by Dr. David Ferrier. Other major works were:

 R. Hooper's Physician's Vade-Mecum; enlarged and improved by W.A.G., (1842 and many subsequent editions). Based on the work by Robert Hooper.
 T. Walker's Original, edited with additions by W.A.G. 1875; another edition 1885. Based on the publication The Original by Thomas Walker.
 Public Health; a Popular Introduction to Sanitary Science, pt. i. 1870; pt. ii. 1874. 
 The Factors of the Unsound Mind, with special reference to the Plea of Insanity in Criminal Cases, 1881. 
 John Howard's Winter's Journey, 1882.

Guy published lectures, and contributed papers to the Statistical Society, including the Influence of Employments on Health, The Duration of Life among different Classes, Temperance and its relation to Mortality, The Mortality of London Hospitals, Prison Dietaries, and John Howard's True Place in History.

"video game animator here! :)

Characters in games are moved programatically not through the animation.  The animation is just there to let the player know what the character is doing.  99% of video game engines will move the character in a straight, linear motion.  So when a character walks upstairs, it's just moving diagonally up at a constant speed.  It's incredibly time consuming for an animator to match the animation to the linear motion for several reasons:

1. Unless there's only one single instance of using the stairs, going up and down the stairs will usually be a variable.  You don't know how many steps each stairs has unless the animator makes an animation for each character matched to each set of stairs.  It can be done, but it takes a long time.  Most animators just create 1 looping animation which can then be used for every time the player goes up the stairs.

2.  It's also difficult for an animator to create a looping animation without being able to first get the angle and speed the program is using for moving the character, and then sort of ""counter animating"" to adjust for the program's movement code.  Again, it can be done, but then that animation will only look nice for that specific stairs.  There's little reason to go through so much effort to create stair-walking-up animations for each set of stairs when you can just create one loop and apply it generically to all of them.

In very large companies such as Ubisoft, Activision, EA, etc... where they have an army of animators, they do have the time and the budget to create animations for very specific purposes, such as Batman's cape when he punches using Punch1, then Punch variation 2, then Punch variation 3, etc...  Smaller companies simply do not have time to dedicate their animator to do these very minute detailed animations that only fit one specific purpose.  Larger companies can."	0

"The water your dehumidifier produces is actually drawn from the air around it. The air contains water vapor that moves into the air from the earth around the walls and floor of your basement. Concrete absorbs water fairly easily. The water moves through it and eventually evaporates into the air on the other side.

Your dehumidifier uses a cold coil of metal that attracts the water vapor in the air to condense onto it (Similar to how a cold glass of water gets wet on the outside of the glass on a warm humid day). As the condensation builds up, it drips down into the catch basin.

If you did not have a humidifier, the water vapor would remain in the air (resulting in higher humidity), and would likely condense over time onto other items in your basement. The dampness would promote the growth of mildew and mold (both things which like to grow in damp areas) and over time become a health hazard, not to mention also possibly damaging anything stored in your basement.

As an aside... Most dehumidifiers have an outlet that you can attach a hose too. I have a hose attached to mine, which then run to the basement drain. Assuming you have a basement drain, this might be a good way to avoid having to empty your dehumidifier bucket every day."	0

We present new observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), which reveal an extended, diffuse source in the vicinity of the radio galaxy PKS 1302-102 at z = 0.084. The ALMA data show that this emission is dominated by dust continuum emission at 870 µm, while the VLA data detect both synchrotron and free-free emission between 1.4 GHz and 5 GHz. We use these data to characterize the physical properties of the intergalactic medium surrounding the host galaxy of PKS 1302-102. Our results indicate that there are two distinct components contributing to the observed emission: one component associated with the host galaxy itself; and another component located along the line-of-sight toward the host galaxy. This second component has a temperature T ~ 10 K and a density n ~ 100 cm-3 .	1

Non-leap years will be referred to throughout the guide as “normal years.” The Gregorian calendar repeats exactly every 400 years. Note that the Gregorian calendar has been reformed in the past and that this algorithm only applies to the Gregorian calendar in its most recent state. For more information on this reform and its consequences for calculating the day of the week, refer to the “Julian calendar” section of the Wikipedia article entitled “Doomsday rule”: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_rule#Julian_calendar.
In this guide, the notation “C.E.” and “B.C.E.” will be used. “C.E.” means “Common Era” and is equivalent to “A.D.” “B.C.E.” means “Before the Common Era” and is equivalent to “B.C.” For more information refer to the Wikipedia article entitled “Common Era”: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Era. Think of C.E. years as positive and B.C.E. years as negative (but subtract one from them first). For example, think of 1670 C.E. as 1670, but think of 1540 B.C.E. as -1539. Note that there is no year 0 in the Gregorian calendar, so you must subtract 1 from 1540 before placing a negative sign in front of it. For a more detailed explanation, see the Wikipedia article entitled “Astronomical year numbering”: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_year_numbering.
In this guide, the formats mm/dd and mm/dd/yyyy will be used to represent dates in compact form. For example, 8/6 is equivalent to August 6th, 7/24/1670 is equivalent to July 24th, 1670 C.E., 12/6/534 is equivalent to December 6th, 534 C.E., and 10/23/-1889 is equivalent to October 23rd, 1890 B.C.E.

, April, June, September, and November have 30 days. February has 28 days during a normal year and 29 days during a leap year. Leap day, that is, the day that only exists during a leap year, is February 29. There is a useful mnemonic to distinguish between months with 31 days and fewer than 31 days. Hold out your right hand. Tap the knuckle of your index finger and say “January.” Tap the gap/dip/valley between the knuckles of your index and middle fingers and say “February.” You can remember that January has more days than February because your knuckle is taller than the gap. Next tap the knuckle of your middle finger and say “March.” Notice as you continue that all of the months with 31 days are on knuckles, while all of the months with fewer days are in gaps. You’re probably wondering: “What do I do once I get to July?” because July is on the knuckle of your pinky. Just go back to the beginning; tap the knuckle of your index finger again and say “August.” Continue from here to get to the rest of the months.

, Here are some easy-to-remember Doomsdays: 4/4, 8/8, 10/10, 12/12, 5/9, 9/5, 7/11, and 11/7. A mnemonic for the last four Doomsdays in the list is: “9 to 5 job at a 7-11 gas station.” For example, in the year 2000, April 4, June 6, July 11, and November 7 are all Tuesdays. (Important note: this does not mean that April 4, 2001 was also Tuesday. April 4, 2001 was actually a Wednesday.) You can add or subtract 7 from any Doomsday to get another Doomsday. For example, 5/9, 5/16, and 5/23 are all Doomsdays. You don’t have to just add or subtract 7 at a time though; you can use any multiple of 7. For example, 9/5 and 9/26 are both Doomsdays, because 5+7*3 ≡ 26. Another easy-to-remember Doomsday is 3/0. No this is not a typo; 3/0 is simply another way of thinking about the last day of February. Unlike 2/28 or 2/29, 3/0 is always the last day of February, regardless of whether or not it is a leap year. The world can even think of months as having negative days. For example, 8/8 and 8/-6 are both Doomsdays. To convert 8/-6 into a normal date, simply add the number of days in the 7th month (August). Use the knuckle trick from the previous paragraph to determine that there are 31 days in August. So, 8/-6 is the same as 7/25, because -6+31 ≡ 25. We may also think of months as having days greater than 31. For example, 10/10 and 10/34 are both Doomsdays. To convert 10/34 into a normal date, simply subtract the number of days in the 10th month (October). Our knuckles tell us that October has 31 days, so 10/34 is 11/3, because 34-31 ≡ 3. We can even write June days as March days. For example, 6/6 and 6/-64 are Doomsdays. May (month 5) has 31 days, so 6/-64 ≡ 5/-33. April (month 4) has 30 days, so 5/-33 ≡ 4/-3. March (month 3) has 31 days, so 4/-3 ≡ 3/28. Thus, June -64th is equivalent to March 28th, which is a Doomsday. Be careful to account for leap years when using these tricks to determine Doomsdays in January or February. For example, in ANY year, 3/0 and 3/-14 are both Doomsdays, but in a leap year February has 29 days, so 3/-14 ≡ 2/15, while in a normal year February has 28 days, so 3/-14 ≡ 2/14. Thus, February 15th is a Doomsday during leap years, but February 14th is a Doomsday during normal years. You have to be careful when going from March to January as well. Leap year: 3/-42 ≡ 2/-13 ≡ 1/18; normal year: 3/-42 ≡ 2/-14 ≡ 1/17.

Sunday ≡ NONEday ≡ 0
Monday ≡ ONEday ≡ 1
Tuesday ≡ TWO’Sday ≡ 2
Wednesday ≡ THREE’Sday ≡ 3 (lame, I know)
Thursday ≡ FOUR’Sday ≡ 4
Friday ≡ FIVEday ≡ 5
Saturday ≡ SIXAday ≡ 6
Sunday ≡ SE’ENday ≡ 7 (“se’en” as in a contraction for “seven” that sounds like “sun”)
Because there are seven days in a week, you can add or subtract any multiple of 7 at ANY point during ANY part of ANY day-of-the-week calculation. This is why Sunday is both 0 and 7. Monday could be thought of as -6, 8, 71, etc. Throughout the guide you will see (and have been seeing) congruence symbols, ≡, rather than equals signs, =, because 71 does NOT equal 8, but they are equivalent for the purpose of determining the day of the week. While finding a day of the week we are only interested in the remainder when numbers are divided by 7. All of these congruence are thus “modulo 7,” abbreviated “mod 7.” Numbers are congruent modulo 7 if their remainders are the same when they are divided by 7. This is equivalent to the earlier point that you can add or subtract multiples of 7 as you wish. For example, 1 ≠ 8, but 1 ≡ 8 (mod 7). More examples of the way in which modulo behave are -15 ≡ -1 ≡ 6 (mod 7) and 4 ≡ -3 ≡ 7004 (mod 7). The notation “(mod 7)” will be left off throughout the guide, because all congruences are assumed to be modulo 7.
If you know that August 8, 1953 is a Saturday, then you can quickly determine that August 4, 1953 is a Tuesday, because four days before SIXAday is TWO’Sday. That is, 6-4 ≡ 2. Likewise, if you know that 9/5/1776 is a FOUR’Sday, then you can quickly see that 9/7/1776 is a SIXAday, because 7-5 ≡ 2 and 4+2 ≡ 6. Remember that you can add or subtract any multiple of 7 to a Number-day. If you know that 10/10/-2543 is a SIXAday, then you can quickly determine that 10/2/-2543 is a FIVEday, because 2-10 ≡ -8 ≡ -8+7 ≡ -1, and 6+(-1) ≡ 5. Once again, remember to watch out for leap years, like 18,400. If you know that 2/28/18,400 is a ONEday, then you can quickly determine that 3/3/18,400 is a FIVEday, because 2/28/18,400 ≡ 3/-1/18,400 and 3-(-1) ≡ 4 and 1+4 ≡ 5.

, For example, every Doomsday in 2009 is a Saturday, so the Year-day of 2009 is Saturday. The “Century-day” of any given century is the “Year-day” of the first year of the century. The “Century-year” is the first year of any given century. The Year-day of 1900 is Wednesday, so the Century-day of the 1900s (i.e. the 20th century) is Wednesday. Also, 1900 is the Century-year of the 20th century. Note though, that the Century-year of the century that -1362 lies in (i.e. the -1300s or the 14th century B.C.E.) is -1400, NOT -1300, because -1400 comes before -1300. Remember also that -1400 is equivalent to 1401 B.C.E., NOT 1400 B.C.E.

, These Year-days are called “Big Tuesdays” (just to help you remember them). Years that are divisible by 400 are called “Big Tuesday-years,” and centuries that have Century-days that are also Big Tuesdays are called “Big Tuesday-centuries.” Thus, the Year-day of 1600 is a Big Tuesday. The Century-days of the 2000s, the -4400s, and the 96,812,000s are all Big Tuesdays, the 2000s, the -4400s, and 96,812,000s are all Big Tuesday-centuries, and 2000, -4400, and 96,812,000 are all Big Tuesday-years.

, Subtract 100 from the Century-year until you get to a Big Tuesday-year. Count how many times you subtracted 100. If you subtracted 100 once, then the Century-day is Sunday; if twice, then it’s Friday; if thrice, then it’s Wednesday; if four or more times, then you messed up, because one of every four Century-years is a Big Tuesday-year. For example, the Century-day of the 1800s is Friday, because you subtract 100 twice to get 1600, which is a Big Tuesday-year (because it’s divisible by 400). The pattern looks like this: 1600 ≡ TWO’Sday ≡ 2, 1700 ≡ SUNday ≡ 0, 1800 ≡ FIVEday ≡ 5 ≡ -2, 1900 ≡ THREE’Sday ≡ 3 ≡ -4, 2000 ≡ TWO’Sday ≡ 2 ≡ -5, and so on. Note that you can get from one Century-day day to the next by subtracting two from the initial Century-day. This only works when the larger of the two adjacent centuries is not a Big Tuesday-century. That’s fine though, because you already know that the Century-day of every Big Tuesday-century is TWO’Sday.

, The “Dozen-day” of any given year is the Year-day of the Dozen-year. The Dozen-day can be calculated by adding the Century-day to the result of the division by 12. For example, the Dozen-year of 1234 is 1224, because 1224-1200 ≡ 24 ≡ 12*2, and no larger years that are still less than or equal to 1234 yield a positive difference with 1200 that is divisible by 12. Since the Year-day of 1224 is Thursday, the Dozen-day of 1234 is also Thursday. Note that the Dozen-days for 1235, 1226, and 1229 are all Thursdays as well; while the Dozen-days for 1236 and 1238 are not the same (they are, in fact, Fridays). For another example, we can calculate the Dozen-day of -1713. We first need to find the Century-day of the -1700s. Since we must subtract 100 three times from -1700 to arrive at a Big Tuesday-year, the Century-day is THREE’Sday. Next we must find the Dozen-year. Note that the Dozen-year is not -1712, but rather -1716, because -1716-(-1800) = 84 = 12*7. So, the Dozen-day of -1713 is 3+7 ≡ 3 ≡ THREE’Sday (since we can subtract 7 as we please).

, The “Quad-day” of any given year is the Year-day of the Quad-year. For example, the Quad-year of 1620 is 1620; while that of 1643 is 1640. The Quad-days of 1640, 1641, 1642, and 1643 are all Wednesday; while the Quad-day of 1620 is Saturday. We can calculate the Quad-day as follows. If the given year is 1642, then the Dozen-year is 1636, because 1636-1600 ≡ 12*3. The Century-year, 1600, is a Big TWO’Sday. 3+2 ≡ 5, so the Dozen-day of 1642 is FIVEday. Subtract 4 from the Quad-year, 1640, until you get to the Dozen-year. Multiply the number of times you subtracted 4 by -2, and add this result to the Dozen-day to get the Quad-day. In our example, 1640-4*1 ≡ 1636, 1*-2 ≡ -2, and 5+(-2) ≡ 3, so the Quad-day of 1642 is Wednesday (as mentioned previously). Wednesday, is thus also the Year-day of 1640.

, Add the result to the Quad-day to get the Year-day. In our example, 1642-1640 ≡ 2, and 2+THREE’Sday ≡ FIVEday, so the Year-day of 1642 is Friday.

, For example, if the date were 9/5/1642, you would already know that it was a Friday. If the date were 6/20/1642, then you would subtract 7 days twice to discover that 6/20/1642 is the same day of the week as 6/6/1642, which is a known Doomsday. This means that 6/20/1642 is also a Doomsday, and is therefore a Friday.

, We know 4/4/1642 is a Doomsday, so we add 14 days to discover that 4/18/1642 is a Doomsday. Now we know that 4/18/1642 is a FIVEday, so we simply add 2 days to find that 4/20/1642 is a SE’ENday. Don’t forget that the nearest known Doomsday may not be in the same month. For example, 3/29/1642 is closer to 4/4/1642 than to 3/0/1642. Since 4/4/1642 ≡ 4/-3/1642 ≡ 3/28/1642, we know that 3/29/1642 ≡ FIVEday + 1 ≡ SIXAday.

"The authors introduce Charged Point Normalization (CPN) which solves problems associated with training deep neural network models using standard backpropagation techniques.  CPN uses only first-order derivatives during its update process so it does not require any additional computation beyond normal SGD updates for most commonly used optimizers such as Adam. 
In addition, unlike many existing methods designed specifically to solve this issue, there are no hyperparameters required when applying CPN since all parameters are learned from data automatically through end-to-end training. 

This work provides several interesting insights into how we should think about solving these issues while also providing practical solutions applicable across different types of machine learning tasks.  

Strengths: 
1. It works well without requiring extra computational resources compared to traditional SGD based approaches.    2. No tuning needed"	1

"Okay, ex-soundie here with my $0.02:

I reckon that you're listening on a bad mix. Or more specifically, the 5.1 mix downmixed to stereo, during which you are *supposed* to bump up the center channel by 6dB, but even that is sometimes not enough. **

If you listen to just the center channel of a surround mix, you will hear pretty much *only dialogue*. If you listen to the left and right channels of a surround mix, you will hear *no dialogue*. The reason for this is complex, but suffice it to say that it was to prevent dialogue from ""drifting"" left or right of the screen. It always comes out of the middle. This has the added advantage of not being mixed in with the rest of the sound, so post-processing won't accidentally quiet it.

Unless you get rid of the center channel and mix it back in with the left and right channels. Then post-processing (also called mastering) can affect it and will sometimes grind down the voice levels if it's not done properly.

**EDIT: People bitching that this is not sufficiently ELI5y:

A *channel* is the part of a soundtrack that comes out of one speaker. For example, in stereo there are two channels: left and right. In 5.1 surround there are six: left, center, right, back-left, back-right, and low-frequency effect (for rumbles and thunder and such). When you reduce the number of channels by combining some of them together, that's called *downmixing*. Typically, a surround mix is downmixed to stereo by adding together the left, back-left and center into the left channel, and the right, back-right and center into the right channel (the LFE channel is usually discarded)."	0
"The proposed approach consists in a greedy layer wise initialization strategy for a deep MLP model, which is followed by global gradient-descent with dropout for fine-tuning. The initialization strategy uses a first randomly initialized sigmoid layer for dimensionality expansion followed by 2 sigmoid layers whose weights are initialized by Marginal Fisher Analysis (MFA) which learns a linear dimensionality reduction based on a neighborhood graph constructed using class label information (i.e. supervised dimensionality reduction). Output layer is a standard softmax layer.

The approach is thus to be added to a growing list of heuristic layer-wise initialization schemes.
The particular choice of initialization strategy, while reasonable, is not sufficiently well motivated in the paper relative to alternatives, and thus feels rather arbitrary.
The paper lacks clarity in the description of the approach:  MFA is poorly explained with undefined notations (in Eq. 4, what is A? It has not been properly defined); the precise use of alluded denoising in the model is also unclear (is there really training of an additional denoting objective, or just input corruption?).

The question of the (arguably mild) inconsistency of applying a linear dimensionality reduction algorithm, that is trained without any sigmoid, and then passing its learned representation through a sigmoid is not even raised. This, in addition to the fact that sigmoid hidden layers are no longer commonly used (why did you not also consider using RELUs?).

More importantly I suspect methodological problems with the experimental comparisons: the paper mentions using *default* values for learning-rate and momentum, and having (arbitrarily?) fixed epoch to 400 (no early stopping?) and L2 regularization to 1e-4 for some models. 
*All* hyper parameters should always be properly hyper-optimized using a validation set (or cross-validation) including early-stopping, and this separately for each model under comparison (ideally also including layer sizes). This is all the more important since you are considering smallish datasets, so that the various initialization strategies act mainly as different indirect regularization schemes: they thus need to be carefully tuned. This casts serious doubts as to the amount of hyper-parameter tuning (close to none?) that went into training the alternative models used for comparison. 

The Marginal Fisher Analysis dimensionality reduction initialization strategy may well offer advantages, but as it currently stands this paper doesn’t yet make a sufficiently convincing case for it, nor provide useful insights into the nature of the expected advantages.

I would also suggest, for image inputs such as CIFAR10, to use the qualitative tool of showing the filters (back projected to input space) learned by the different initialization schemes under consideration, as this could help visually gain insight as to what sets methods apart.

The authors present an interesting idea - using sketch-based multi-task learning as a way to speed up exploration when solving complex problems like those found in video-games.  The proposed algorithm has several nice properties including being able to solve multiple related tasks at once while still allowing individual tasks to have different goals/objectives.   However there are some issues I feel should be addressed before this could become practical.    1) It would help if they provided more details about how their system works... For example it isn't clear whether all tasks share the same set of sub-policies? Or do you need separate sets depending upon which tasks you're trying to accomplish?  Also it's unclear exactly where these sub-policy modules fit into your overall architecture?    Another issue I'm having trouble understanding is why you'd want to use a critic network instead of just directly estimating value function gradients wrt action values?	1

"It's fantasy wish fulfillment from the safety of the couch.

Twilight touches on a lot of buttons that, to be *really sexist for a moment*, a lot of women have. Women are, in the US at least, made to feel like a thing to be *valued*. A *thing* to be valued. A *thing*. 

For many, many women (and men) life is a series of obstacles where they feel that their true inner self is never realized or loved for what it is. How they see themselves doesn't reflect on how others see them. They feel they have the beautiful soul of an artist, but on the outside they can only manage drab.

Twilight got this right. The main character is a tedious, boring as shit person. She just.. cries. She cries about her frustrations about being unseen. This resonates with a lot of people on a lot of levels. Good or bad writing, or whatever, it hit that nerve spot on. Then, someone SWOOPS IN and sees *past all their shit* and *loves them for what is on the inside* in such a perfect way. And then *she is fought over* because she is *so valued* as a commodity. 

It's fucked up emotionally manipulative garbage. 

50 Shades is this on steroids. In 50 Shades of Grey, the woman is similarly weak, boring, stupid, whatever. She feels all the negative things about herself.

The handsome, rich, well endowed, dominant wonderful perfect man swoops in and *sees her perfection on the inside*. Because *many, many women* feel they are things that are more beautiful on the inside, this resonates. That man then takes her forcefully *but so gently* through all this sexy time. It is a disney dream where your pussy gets fucked. It's porn. Total, straight up, hyperfantasy porn. 

Thankfully, most people realize this. Again, to be *very sexist* women *tend* to prefer their porn more mental and verbal than they do visual and visceral. There are of course many exceptions. 

But, we have a long history of books-as-porn marketed almost entirely to women. Many romance movies are *exactly the same thing* except they don't go quite as far.

Edit-

I should also mention that fantasy is not necessarily the same thing as desire. We all have fantasies that we actually have no desire to act upon. It's just fun, and ultimately harmless."	0

"John Webber  (6 October 1751 – 29 May 1793) was an English artist who accompanied Captain Cook on his third Pacific expedition. He is best known for his images of Australasia, Hawaii and Alaska.

Biography 
Webber was born in London, educated in Bern and studied painting at Paris. His father was Abraham Wäber, a Swiss sculptor who had moved to London, and changed his name to Webber before marrying a Mrs Mary Quant in 1744.

Webber served as official artist on James Cook's third voyage of discovery around the Pacific (1776–1880) aboard . At Adventure Bay in January 1777 he did drawings of ""A Man of Van Diemen's Land"" and ""A Woman of Van Diemen's Land"". He also did many drawings of scenes in New Zealand and the South Sea islands. On this voyage, during which Cook lost his life in a fight in Hawaii, Webber became the first European artist to make contact with Hawaii, then called the Sandwich Islands.  He made numerous watercolor landscapes of the islands of Kauai and Hawaii, and also portrayed many of the Hawaiian people.

In April 1778, Captain Cook's ships Resolution and Discovery anchored at Ship Cove, now known as Nootka Sound, Vancouver Island, Canada to refit. The crew took observations and recorded encounters with the local people. Webber made watercolour landscapes including ""Resolution and Discovery in Ship Cove, 1778"". His drawings and paintings were engraved for the British Admiralty's account of the expedition, which was published in 1784.

Back in England in 1780 Webber exhibited around 50 works at Royal Academy exhibitions between 1784 and 1792, and was elected an associate of the Royal Academy in 1785 and R.A. in 1791. Most of his work were landscapes. Sometimes figures were included as in ""A Party from H.M.S. Resolution shooting sea horses"", which was shown at the academy in 1784, and his ""The Death of Captain Cook"" became well known through an engraving of it. Another version of this picture is in the William Dixson gallery at Sydney.

Collections
The Anchorage Museum of History and Art (Alaska), the Bishop Museum (Honolulu), the Honolulu Museum of Art, the Peabody Essex Museum (Salem, Massachusetts), the Yale University Art Gallery, the British Museum, the Sir John Soane's Museum (London), The National Maritime Museum (London), the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa
, the John Carter Brown Library, and the Mitchell Library (Australia) are among the public collections holding works by John Webber.

Australia
Webber's art is held by a number of Australian institutions including the National Portrait Gallery (William Bligh, c.1776, The Death of Captain Cook (engraving), 1784, and Portrait of Captain James Cook RN, 1782); the Australian National Maritime Museum (View of Huaheine, 1784); the Art Gallery of New South Wales (A View in Otaheite Peha, 1785); the National Library of Australia (includes 
Sea Otter, 1778, A Woman of Pulo Condore, 1780, Portrait of Captain John Gore, 1780, Poedua, Daughter of Orea, King of Ulietea, Society Islands, 1782, Portrait of Captain James King, 1782, A Dance in Otaheite, 1784,  A Woman of Van Diemen's Land, 1784, A Chief of the Sandwich Islands, 1787, and The Resolution Beating Through the Ice, 1792,); the Dixson Library (includes An Opossum of Van Diemen's Land, 1777, Red-tailed Tropic Bird, 1777, and The Death of Captain Cook, c.1781–83.); and the National Gallery of Victoria (A Night Dance by Men, in Hapaee, 1784, A Young Woman of the Sandwich Islands, 1784, and A Man of Van Diemen's Land, 1784.).

The TACTIC (Telescope Array for Cosmic Triggered Events) is an imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope located in Namibia at the site of the HESS experiment, and it was designed to detect gamma rays with energies between 100 GeV and 10 TeV. The camera consists of 960 photomultiplier tubes arranged on a hexagonal grid covering a field-of-view of 3 degrees diameter. It has been taking data since March 2009. In this work we present results obtained by applying different analysis techniques to the first two years of data taken with the TACTIC telescope. We show that these analyses are able to reconstruct events with high efficiency over most of the energy range covered by the instrument. Finally, we compare our results with those published by other experiments operating in similar energy ranges. This article is part of the themed issue 'The Universe as seen by ground-based gamma-ray telescopes'. Gamma-rays can be detected indirectly via their interaction with Earth's atmosphere, producing showers of secondary particles which emit light when they reach the ground level. These so-called air-shower photons can then be observed using large optical detectors such as imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs). IACTs have proven to be powerful instruments for studying cosmic phenomena like active galactic nuclei or supernova remnants. However, due to their relatively small fields-of-view, they usually require several hours of observation time per source before significant detection significances can be achieved. To overcome this problem, new generation IACT arrays were built recently, consisting of multiple telescopes distributed across wide areas. One example is the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) [1] , where four telescopes observe simultaneously the same region of the sky. Another one is the Telescope Array for Cosmic Triggerd Events (TACTIC), which will consist of eight telescopes spread out over a distance of about 1 km [2] .	1
"  A new kind of quantum indeterminacy of transverse position is shown to arise
from quantum degrees of freedom of spacetime, based on the assumption that
classical trajectories can be defined no better than the diffraction limit of
Planck scale waves. Indeterminacy of the angular orientation of particle
trajectories due to wave/particle duality at the Planck scale leads to
indeterminacy of a nearly-flat spacetime metric, described as a small
nonvanishing quantum commutation relation between transverse position operators
at different events along a null trajectory. An independent derivation of the
same effect is presented based on the requirement of unitarity in black hole
evaporation. The indeterminacy is interpreted as a universal holographic
quantum spacetime noise, with a frequency-independent spectrum of metric
perturbation amplitude, h_H^2^{1/2} \simeq \sqrt{l_P}=2.3 \times 10^{-22}
/\sqrt{Hz}, where l_P denotes the Planck length. The effect is estimated to be
directly measurable using current interferometer technology similar to LIGO and
LISA.

"Section 1, Introduction:
A neural network that can be shown theoretically of high invertibility does not necessarily perform well. For example, ResNets over 34 layers, which are impossible to analyze using the proposed theoretical framework, perform significantly better than VGGNets with much fewer parameters but a lot more depth; by comparison, a standard variational autoencoder would have a lot worse generative power if we set the penalty for the prior KL-divergence term to be very small and encourage good reconstruction.
 “Despite these interesting results, there is no clear theoretical explanations as to why CNNs are invertible yet”. There are multiple issues with this statement. First of all, this invertibility is a rather trivial common knowledge among ML researchers; people don’t like to analytically explore because its theoretical bounds are too bad—as proved once again in this submission. Second of all, their theoretical proof does not consider non-linear layer and it does not have the correct convolutional setup (details to come at Section 3 (3)) and their theoretical bounds have no meaningful implications for training or network design. Third of all, there have been works exploring such signal recovery property with random filters on fully connected layers ([2] and [3]) as well as exploring such property with learned filters on convolutional layers ([1] and [5]). They all have very similar underlying mathematical models and highly resembling reconstruction algorithms ([1] and [2]) with this submission. The authors ignore addressing these important related works. Lastly, their analysis only tackles a single layer, which does not improve upon existing works, especially considering that [2] takes into account of multiple layers as well as dropout stability.

Disposable Sumatriptan Auto-injectors are used for treating migraine attacks.  They contain medication that can help relieve symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light/sounds/smells/touching/smellings, blurred vision/double vision/motion sickness.   The injections should only be administered by trained medical professionals who have received proper training.    This method does NOT work for everyone suffering from migraines so consult your doctor about other treatment options first.     If you're experiencing severe pain during a migraine attack then call emergency services instead of trying this technique yourself.   You may also want to try over-the-counter medications like acetaminophen (Tylenol®).    Consult your physician prior to taking these steps if you:  Have high blood pressure and/or heart disease Have diabetes Have asthma Take certain prescription drugs regularly Are pregnant or breastfeeding Don't know how long you've had migraines Headaches caused...   Your doctor might prescribe one type of disposable auto-injector system depending upon their assessment of your health condition....	1
"A new sparse coding model is introduced that learns features jointly with their transformations. It is found that inference over per-image transformation variables is hard, so the authors suggest tying these variables across all data points, turning them into global parameters, and using multiple transformations for each feature. Furthermore, it is suggested to use a tree of transformations, where each path down the tree generates a feature by multiplying the root feature by the transformations associated with the edges. The one-layer tree model achieves similar reconstruction error as traditional sparse coding, while using fewer parameters.

This is a nice addition to the literature on sparse coding and the literature on learning transformation models. The authors identify and deal with a difficult inference problem that can occur in transformation models. That said, I am skeptical about the usefulness of the general approach. The authors take it as a given that “learning sparse features and transformations jointly” is an important goal in itself, but this is never really argued or demonstrated with experiments. It doesn’t seem like this method enables new applications, extends our understanding of learning what/where pathways in the brain, or improve our ability to model natural images.

The authors claim that the model extracts pose information, but although the model explicitly captures the transformation that relates different features in a tree, at test time, inference is only performed over the (sparse) coefficient associated with each (feature, transformation) combination, just like in sparse coding. It is not clear what we gain by knowing that each coefficient is associated with a transformation, especially since there are many models that do this general “what / where” split.

It would be good to check that the x_{v->b} actually change significantly from their initialization values. The loss surface still looks pretty bad even for tied transformations, so they may actually not move much. Does the proposed model work better according to some measure, compared to a model where x_{v->b} are fixed and chosen from some reasonable range of parameter values (either randomly or spaced evenly)?

One of the conceptually interesting aspects of the paper is the idea of a tree of transformations, but the advantage of deeper trees is never demonstrated convincingly. It looks like the authors have only just gotten this approach to work on toy data with vertical and horizontal bars.

Finally, it is not clear how the method could be extended to have multiple layers. The transformation operators T can be defined in the first layer because they act on the input space, but the same cannot be done in the learned feature space. It is also not clear how the pose information should be further processed in a hierarchical manner, or how learning in a deep version should work.

In summary, I do not recommend this paper for publication, because it is not clear what problem is being solved, the method is only moderately novel and the novel aspects are not convincingly shown to be beneficial.

"No, it's not their product but it is good business sense because if we use less of what they're providing then they'll have more to sell and make money from in future years. It's also better for our environment as well so everyone wins! They don't actually want you to stop using your appliances or lights - just turn them off when you're done with them instead of leaving them on all night (or leave them at low settings). This will help reduce demand which means lower prices too!
If there was no one buying electricity how would power plants be able to produce any? No, that's not true. Power stations can still operate without anyone paying anything. The only difference being they'd need to pay themselves back first before making profits. If people stopped buying electricity completely we'd see massive price rises across the board though... Yes, this makes perfect sense now doesn't it?! Energy companies aren't trying to get rid of customers who buy their products - they simply want those same customers to consume less by turning down thermostats, unplugging unused electronics etc"	1

Roller hockey has been growing rapidly over recent years.  The sport was first played at an international level during the 1998 Winter Olympics.   It is now considered by many to be more popular than ice-hocky (which requires expensive facilities).   There are currently two major professional leagues - the National League and Elite League.    This guide will help you learn basic skills required to become a good roller hockey goaltender.   You may also want to read How To Play Ice-Hockey if you'd prefer playing this version instead.     Equipment needed includes:  A pair of skates (preferably speed skates) An approved protective mask Protective gloves Pads Guards Helmets Skate guards Shoulders Catching mitt Stick Glasses Goggles    If possible try renting from local rinks before buying any gear online...or anywhere else!     Rental prices vary depending upon location but expect to pay between £5-10 per hour....   1. Warm-up properly 2. Learn positioning 3. Develop reflexes 4. Practice frequently 5.	1
It works by blocking pain receptors in your brain, which makes it easier to perform surgery on patients without causing them any discomfort or distress.  The amount of medication given depends upon several factors including age, weight, gender etc... It can be administered through an intravenous line (IV), inhalation gas mask, oral ingestion pill form, subcutaneous injection under skin tissue, epidural block into spinal cord area near spine, topical creams applied directly onto surgical site and/or nerve endings, local infiltrative injections around nerves at specific sites within body cavity/space where incision will occur as well as regional blocks such as Bier's Block used during cesarean section delivery procedures. IV = Intravenous Line; Inhalation Gas Mask = Anesthesia machine with breathing tube attached to face mask covering mouth/nose/mouthpiece; Oral Ingestion Pill Form = pills taken via mouth prior to surgery; Subcutaneous Injection Under Skin Tissue = needle inserted just below surface of skin between muscle layers; Epidural Block Into Spinal Cord Area Near Spine = needle injected into space surrounding spinal column; Topical Creams Applied Directly Onto Surgical Site/Nerve Endings = cream rubbed over areas requiring surgery; Local Infiltrative Injections Around Nerves At Specific Sites Within Body Cavity/Space Where Incision Will Occur As Well As Regional Blocks Such As Bier's Block Used During Cesarean Section Delivery Procedures	1

By taking the sine of the cell 6 rows above the cell we're in, C6, the formula is taking the sine of 0, which = 0. Therefore, between the formula in C6 and the one in D6, the {x,y} coordinates of the first cell would be {1,0} if nothing else were affecting them. It proceeds counterclockwise from there. so that is how to read the chart, from 0 degrees counter clockwise back to 360 degrees. Even though there are basically 2880 rows being charted, and 2880/360 = 8, Factor1 = 1/8th at .125, so a level of detail is achieved while keeping everything normalized for a single cycle in the typical case.

"Folding maps is an important skill if you're planning any kind of outdoor adventure.  The following instructions will teach you how to fold and store a topo map (a detailed roadmap) properly.   This method works best when used with large-format paper maps such as USGS 1:24000 scale maps; however, smaller-scale maps can be folded similarly but may require more folds than are described here.    If you'd like additional tips about caring for your map once you've finished folding it, see How To Store A Paper Map. Choose a clear, zip-closed plastic bag big enough to hold all four sides of the map together without stretching them out too much.  You should also choose a bag that's thick enough not to tear easily while being pulled across rough terrain.     For example, a standard-size 8 1/2"" x 11"" sheet of printer paper would fit into a small sandwich baggie made of heavy-duty plastic. Place the map face-down onto a clean work surface.  Make sure there aren't any wrinkles or creases in..."	1
"  Longitudinal data tracking repeated measurements on individuals are highly
valued for research because they offer controls for unmeasured individual
heterogeneity that might otherwise bias results. Random effects or mixed models
approaches, which treat individual heterogeneity as part of the model error
term and use generalized least squares to estimate model parameters, are often
criticized because correlation between unobserved individual effects and other
model variables can lead to biased and inconsistent parameter estimates.
Starting with an examination of the relationship between random effects and
fixed effects estimators in the standard unobserved effects model, this article
demonstrates through analysis and simulation that the mixed model approach has
a ``bias compression'' property under a general model for individual
heterogeneity that can mitigate bias due to uncontrolled differences among
individuals. The general model is motivated by the complexities of longitudinal
student achievement measures, but the results have broad applicability to
longitudinal modeling.

"  %Context: {Previous studies have indicated that the 372.4 GHz ground
transition of ortho-H$_2$D$^+$ might be a powerful probe of Proto-Planetary
Disks. The line could be especially suited for study of the disk mid-plane,
where the bulk of the mass resides and where planet formation takes place.}
%Aims: {Provide detailed theoretical predictions for the line intensity,
profile and maps expected for representative disk models.} %Methods: {We
determine the physical and chemical structure of the disks from the model
developed by Ceccarelli & Dominik (2005). The line emission is computed with
the new radiative transfer method developed recently by Elitzur & Asensio Ramos
(2006).} %Results: {We present intensity maps convolved with the expected ALMA
resolution, which delineate the origin of the H$_2$D$^+$ 372.4 GHz line. In the
disk inner regions, the line probes the conditions in the mid-plane out to
radial distances of a few tens of AU, where Solar-like planetary systems might
form. In the disk outermost regions, the line originates from slightly above
the mid-plane. When the disk is spatially resolved, the variation of line
profile across the image provides important information about the velocity
field. Spectral profiles of the entire disk flux show a double peak shape at
most inclination angles.} %Conclusions: {Our study confirms that the 372.4 GHz
H$_2$D$^+$ line provides powerful diagnostics of the mid-plane of
Proto-Planetary Disks. Current submillimeter telescopes are capable of
observing this line, though with some difficulties. The future ALMA
interferometer will have the sensitivity to observe and even spatially resolve
the H$_2$D$^+$ line emission.}

"  We study $B \to K^* \rho$ modes that are analogues of the much studied $B\to
K \pi$ modes with B decaying to two vector mesons instead of pseudoscalar
mesons, using topological amplitudes in the quark diagram approach. We show how
$B \to K^*\rho$ modes can be used to obtain many more observables than those
for $B \to K \pi$ modes, even though the quark level subprocesses of both modes
are exactly the same. All the theoretical parameters (except for the weak phase
$\gamma$), such as the magnitudes of the topological amplitudes and their
strong phases, can be determined in terms of the observables without any
model-dependent assumption. We demonstrate how $B\to K^*\rho$ can also be used
to verify if there exist any relations between theoretical parameters, such as
the hierarchy relations between the topological amplitudes and possible
relations between the strong phases. Conversely, if there exist reliable
theoretical estimates of amplitudes and strong phases, the presence of New
physics could be probed. We show that if the tree and color-supressed tree are
related to the electroweak penguins and color-supressed electroweak penguins,
it is not only possible to verify the validity of such relations but also to
have a clean measurement of New Physics parameters. We also present a numerical
study to examine which of the observables are more sensitive to New Physics.

"The authors propose an unrolling method for GANs that is able to train on large datasets with high efficiency.
Strengths: 
1) The proposed approach can be applied in many applications where training data are limited but computational resources are abundant. 
2) It also provides insights into how different network architectures affect performance of GANs. 

Weaknesses: 
1) There may exist other ways to improve the convergence speed besides increasing batch size. 


2) How does this work when we have multiple generators? Problem statement: In recent years generative adversarial networks (GANs), which learn from both real-world examples as well as generated samples, has become one of most popular methods used in computer vision tasks such as image generation, super-resolution reconstruction etc.. However, it suffers from slow learning process due to its unstable nature during optimization procedure."	1
" By listing your obstacles, you can begin to address and overcome them.


Be honest with yourself when making your list. Don’t write, “I have no time” if the real reason is that you don’t know how to get started.
Creating an honest list of reasons can also help you see that you don’t have as many obstacles as you thought.
For example, you may think you have lots of obstacles to you meditating, but after writing them down, find out that you only have two or three.;
,


If you don't have time to spend an hour meditating, or you get frustrated easily, then try half an hour. Or ten minutes.
One true moment in meditation will be greater than one hour spent fidgeting and grumbling.
Try meditating first thing in the morning or last thing at night. At these times, you will probably be least busy and will find it easier to be motivated to meditate.
Moreover, early morning meditation may help you focus throughout the day, and late night meditation may help you sleep more deeply.

, While simply scheduling it in may not motivate you to meditate, at least you won't have anything else to do at that moment. And since you don’t have anything else to do, why not meditate?


Get out your calendar, planner, or agenda and write the time in for meditation each day or every few days.
Add it to your daily To Do list or set a daily alarm on your electronic device.
You may want to start by scheduling about half an hour for your meditation session and then increasing it over time.

, If you feel physically uncomfortable in one posture, then motivate yourself to meditate by trying another position.


If you are uncomfortable, you'll hardly be able to motivate yourself to practice meditation on a regular basis!
Try sitting on a pillow, cushion, or mat if you are going to meditate on the floor. You can lean against a wall as you sit if you need to.
Meditate while sitting in a chair. Sit back in the chair and make sure you feel comfortable before you begin meditating.
You can also meditate while lying down.

, But, you can motivate yourself to meditate if you remind yourself that in meditation, there is no such thing as failure.Or success, really. With meditation you are attached to the process, not to your results.


Tell yourself, “I can’t be good or bad at meditating. I can’t succeed at it or fail. But, I can do it.”
If you must think of things in terms of success or failure, then consider it a success anytime you attempt to meditate.
For example, if you can only meditate for a minute or two at a time, then give yourself credit for that!

, By thinking about your reasons you will be addressing obstacles to you meditating. And just by focusing your thinking on this one topic, you will actually be meditating.


For example, focus your mind on the thought, “I can find a way to overcome the obstacles to me meditating.”
Allow your thoughts and concerns about meditation to flow freely. Gently redirect your thoughts if they stray from the topic of meditating.
You might say to yourself, “I’m thinking about dinner. Let me think more about meditating.”
As you think of obstacles, ask yourself, “How can I overcome this obstacle?”

" Vanilla orchids require a tropical environment, so you will need sunlight, heat, space and humidity for it to grow. If you live in the South of the United States, Australia or another warm climate you may be able to cultivate vanilla outside.


Your environment should be 65 degrees (18 Celsius) or warmer all year to successfully cultivate an orchid. Warmer temperatures are preferable.;
, You can improve the greenhouse conditions until they are ideal for this type of orchid that requires heat, humidity and partial shade.

, If you don’t have a local florist or garden center that sells these, you may need to order them online. Ensure each cutting is at least one foot (30 cm) long.


If you are ordering cuttings online, you may want to purchase several to improve your chances of having a vanilla crop.
Cuttings are usually taken from mature plants that are 20 feet (6 m) or more in length.

,, The ends should remain immersed for five days. Notice which end is the top and which is the bottom.

Add a pinch of liquid fertilizer to improve results.
The top is the direction in which the plant has been growing. The leaves will point down toward the bottom of the cutting., It will need shade 50 percent of the time, as well as constant support to grow vines. If you are using a trellis, you will need to create a shaded area above the plant.

, Lay the bottom two nodes of the plant horizontally on the top of the soil. Nodes are vine intersections.


Orchid soil is usually a combination of pine bark, perlite and mulch.

,, It must be trained to grow vertically. You can purchase ties or clips online or at a gardening store.

,, Never allow the soil to dry out, yet don’t allow it to get too saturated or it can rot.

, The mulch is its food so it should be rich in organic matter.

,, Air roots will attach upward to the support and others will reach down to the soil. It will take between two and seven years for the plant to grow large enough to bloom.

, It will encourage roots to grow and the plant to grow larger., It only flowers for a six week period per year and the flowers only last approximately one day.During this time, you will need to hand pollinate the flower in order to grow the vanilla beans.

, Consider asking a local orchid grower to help you hand-pollinate the first few times. It is a very delicate process.

, Push the pollen mass out and hold it up with your right thumb and index finger. Use your middle finger to push the anther back and expose the cam underneath it, which serves as a shield.


Place the pollen on the ridge. Push the ridge back into place with your left hand and pull the cap back down.
Repeat with all the flowers.
Pollinate in the morning. Some sources suggest 11 am is the best time., If it begins to elongate instead of point up, it is pollinated.

, Pods should appear within two months; however, they take nine months to mature.

,, Spread your beans on trays and place them in direct sunlight for three hours. Fold them inside cloth to sweat overnight.


Repeat each day until the pods turn a deep brown.
Hang them or place them in drying rooms for two to four weeks.

"Neutrinos are neutral leptons that can oscillate between different flavors, and the phenomenon is described by the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) matrix. The PMNS matrix contains three mixing angles θ12, θ23, θ13 and one complex phase δCP which describes possible CP-violation effects. In this work we study how to probe CP violation using atmospheric neutrinos detected at IceCube Neutrino Observatory. We show that it will be possible to measure the value of sin(2θ13), if its magnitude is larger than 0.1, as well as the sign of cos(δCP). This measurement would provide important information on the origin of matter-antimatter asymmetry observed in our universe. 
 
 Introduction 
 
 Neutrinos are neutral leptonic particles that can change their flavor during propagation through space-time. These changes occur because of quantum mechanical interference effects: when two or more mass eigenstates propagate together they interfere destructively or constructively depending on their relative phases [1] . If there exists an intrinsic difference between these phases then the probability for detecting a certain flavor after traveling some distance differs from what would have been expected without such differences [2] .
 
The phenomenon of neutrino oscillation has been confirmed experimentally [3] , but the exact values of the parameters describing the process remain unknown [4] . One of them is the so-called Dirac phase $\delta_{CP}$ [5] , which determines whether the total lepton number $L$ is conserved [6] . It also affects the amount of baryon asymmetry produced in the early Universe [7, 8] . Therefore measuring the value of $\delta_{CP}$ could shed light on the physics behind the generation of matter-antimattery asymmetry [9] . 
 
 There exist several experiments searching for CP violation in the neutrino sector [10] . However, most of those experiments use accelerator-based beams of neutrinos [11] . On the other hand, neutrino telescopes detect cosmic neutrinos coming from all directions [12] . They offer unique opportunities to perform measurements complementary to those performed in accelerators [13] . For example, neutr"	1
"Because they claim to be calling out the worst parts of Reddit on ignorance on bigotry but in fact may be the most ignorant and bigoted subreddit in existence. They invent conflict and intent where it does not exist, they hypocritically make extremely disturbing and unfounded accusations and generalizations that are more fucked up than anything they complain about (I saw a post where an SRSer claimed that most males on reddit ""probably have raped someone, but they don't want to admit it to themselves"") and then claim that it's ""all part of the really funny circle jerk and you just don't get it"". Which is ironically the logic they so viciously berate Redditors for using to defend slightly off-color comments and jokes.

But the biggest reason is that they instantly perma-ban anyone who dares to question the raging mob of self-aggrandizing inoffensiveness. People in that subreddit will call out individual users by name, and say how that person is a pathetic, sexist, racist, virgin who has probably raped someone and then instantly ban anyone who claims otherwise, especially the person they are so gleefully tearing to shreds. They are taking the worst parts of people like the extreme Christian Fundamentalists who wrap themselves in a shield of God's love and then tell every normal person they are going to burn in hell for all eternity because they are a sinner and pure evil, and take any dissent as an all-out attack and respond like it's war.

"This is an interesting work exploring how RNNs could adapt their computational complexity depending upon what type of sequences are being processed.  The authors propose using different activation functions within individual cells so that some may compute more than others during training but then all will operate similarly once trained.
The results presented here seem promising although I am curious about whether there were any issues related to overfitting when trying out these new approaches? It would be good if future research looked into ways to prevent this from happening since it seems like one potential issue might arise due to having multiple layers operating under varying levels of activity. Overall though it's definitely worth reading!

"I'm a psychology BA and a current social work MA student who plans on being a therapist. This isn't my area of expertise, however, I'll do my best to explain what I know. Gender dysphoria (formerly Gender identity disorder) is a mental illness in which one feels that the sex they are born into does not match the gender roles that they fulfill,this can lead to feelings of distress and unhappiness in the person experiencing the incongruence. That's kind of the heart of the issue. This person is born male or female, but does not self identify with the gender roles that our society assigns to those sexes.

Now, why is it a mental illness? We classify certain patterns of thinking, feeling, and behaving as ""pathological"" only when they meet what many researchers refer to as ""the four D's of abnormality"". 

1. Is the behavior causing distress? - For people with gender dysphoria, the answer is not always yes. They sometimes feel uncomfortable, but there are varying degrees of this discomfort. I don't know the average reported distress level in this population, but I imagine that feeling that your body betrays your identity must be a difficult experience.

2. Is the behavior deviant? - This isn't meant to sound judgmental, although the word ""deviant"" is laden with some unfortunate implications. What we mean when we ask this is ""is this what we expect MOST people, on average, to be experiencing, given their unique life circumstances"". For gender dysphoria, the answer is no. Experiencing this dysphoria is not something most people report. Gender dysphoria should also be differentiated here from men or women wanting to blur gender roles and do things that the opposite sex would do. Men do feminine things and women do masculine things, this is not indicative that someone has gender dysphoria. Gender dysphoria is really about a complete transition and bodily transformation from one sex to the other, and then adopting all those gender roles as a full-time member of that sex. People take hormone replacement drugs, get surgeries, get voice training, adopt a whole new name and wardrobe, etc. The transformation changes everything as much as possible, sometimes permanently.

3. Is the behavior causing dysfunction? - Does this person wake up in the morning, take a shower, go to work, eat normal meals, have satisfying social relationships, pay all their bills, and generally tend to the demands of daily life? For people with gender dysphoria, the answer is probably mixed. If the dysphoria is intense and it creates feelings of depression, worthlessness, anxiety, and suicidality, then perhaps they aren't functional. They might be using drugs as a means to cope with the frustration, or they might seek pleasure in other unhealthy ways as a means to self-soothe and find some measure of satisfaction. People with gender dysphoria who transition and live full-time as the opposite sex however are certainly able to be happy, normal, and tend to their lives just as anyone else.

4. Is the behavior dangerous? - This one is very straightforward. Behavior is abnormal when it puts ones self or others in harms way. This criteria is not often used, although it something to consider. People with severe eating disorders, psychotic disorders, and sometimes even major depressive disorder can pose a risk to themselves and others. For people with gender dysphoria, the answer is likely that they aren't dangerous to themselves, however, the distress caused by the dysphoria could enable other more dangerous behaviors (drug taking, aggression, suicidality, etc).

So considering the 4 D's, I think that its fair to say that gender dysphoria is a mental illness ONLY WHEN the experience of the dysphoria causes distress, dysfunction, and is dangerous to the person. It is a given that most people experience their sex as their gender, so it is obvious that this is deviant from the average human experience. That does not mean that it is less good or less psychologically healthy than congruent experiences of sex and gender. People can live very happy lives post-transition, but the disorder described is really about focusing on people who are suffering because of the dysphoric sensations.

In the United States (where I will be practicing) we refer to the DSM-IV-TR as the standard manual for diagnosing and defining the parameters of what constitutes a mental illness. The DSM-V is coming out sometime next year (supposedly), and the website that the American Psychiatric Association has created to watch the changes being made between the two editions is worth checking out. Here is the page that references the new criteria for gender dysphoria: _URL_0_

I hope this helps!

"The authors present TARTAN, a derivative of the previously published DNN accelerator architecture: “DaDianNao”. The key difference is that TARTAN’s compute units are bit-serial and unroll MAC operation over several cycles. This enables the units to better exploit any reduction in precision of the input activations for improvement in performance and energy efficiency.

Comments:

1. I second the earlier review requesting the authors to be present more details on the methodology used for estimating energy numbers for TARTAN. It is claimed that TARTAN gives only a 17% improvement in energy efficiency. However, I suspect that this small improvement is clearly within the margin of error ij energy estimation.  

2. TARTAN is a derivative of DaDianNao, and it heavily relies the overall architecture of DaDianNao. The only novel aspect of this contribution is the introduction of the bit-serial compute unit, which (unfortunately) turns out to incur a severe area overhead (of nearly 3x over DaDianNao's compute units).

3. Nonetheless, the idea of bit-serial computation is certainly quite interesting. I am of the opinion that it would be better appreciated (and perhaps be even more relevant) in a circuit design / architecture focused venue."	0
This recipe makes two 8-inch (20-cm) round layers.  You can make this gender reveal cake using any color combination you like; however, most people choose either all-pink or all-blue because these colors are traditionally associated with girls' and boys' births respectively.   This is an easy-to-make cake that requires no special equipment other than a mixing spoon, whisk, measuring cup, and electric mixer.    Preheat your oven to 350°F/180°C/Gas Mark 4.     Grease 2 large 9 inch (23 cm)  loaf pans by rubbing cooking spray over each side then wiping off excess oil with paper towels.     In another medium sized bowl combine 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar and 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon. Stir well so they mix evenly.        Whisk the egg whites separately until soft peaks form before adding them to the creamed mixture. Continue beating at high speed until everything has been incorporated thoroughly. The dough will be thick but still runny.      Let the batter rest for 5 minutes after removing from heat.	1
The skin takes time to warm up and expand, causing redness in areas that were exposed to sunlight. The blood vessels dilate as they heat up which causes inflammation of the capillaries under your skin.  This is what makes it look like you’re burning from the inside out! Sunlight also damages DNA within cells by breaking down their genetic material into fragments called pyrimidine dimers (PD). These PDs are removed through cell division but if this process fails then mutations can occur leading to cancerous growths on the skin or other parts of the body. It may take several days before these damaged cells die off completely leaving behind visible signs such as dark spots and wrinkles. Answer not in context  - see above .

 Clare Greet - Mrs. Albert

Preservation status
The film is now considered a lost film, but the screenplay still exists. While working on this film, an affair between Hugh Williams and Renee Gadd began.

Critical reception
The New York Times wrote, ""the British studios contribute a well-bred little mystery picture to the Broadway market in White Face, which is at the Broadway Theatre. An Edgar Wallace product, tailor-made according to the formula for these matters, it places a corpse in a slummy London street at midnight, sets the hounds of Scotland Yard baying up several wrong trees, and in good time whips the mask off the mysterious White Face. On Hollywood standards it is a pleasant enough item for the homicide enthusiasts, suffering generally from a faintly anemic quality and specifically from an absence of humor.""

"Med student here. The topvoted answers don't tell the whole truth. There are two reasons as to why pain is delayed/inhibited. 

ELI5:

The first is that the inflammatory process takes time. It takes time for pain-inducing chemicals to be produced/released and for these to affect nerves, by activating them.

The second reason is that your body has a store of molecules that can be released in the spinalcord in stressful situations, which actually have a pain-dampening effect. They block pain-signals travelling to the brain, making you unaware of the pain. When the stressful situation is over and the effect of the inhibitory molecules passes, you will be made aware of the pain


NOT ELI5:

Reason 1: Inflammatory mediators need to be released and/or created by inflammatory cells, and need to make their way to nerve endings. Histamine for example, also causes the blood vessels to increase in permeability, effectively making exudate from the blood flow into the tissue. The increased swelling in the tissue also presses on nerves (nociceptors - sensory nerves that carry pain signals), activating them which also leads to pain, once the signal reaches the brain.

As a fight or flight response the following happens:

Reason 2: Basically what happens when you dont feel pain at the actual time of injury is your body releasing inhibitory neurotransmittors (endorphins (endogenous morphines), GABA, noradrenaline etc) in the spinal cord which inhibits pain signals travelling up to the brain, and hence less, if any, pain signals reach the brain, making you unaware of the pain. 

Edit: Added another reason for pain inhibition. These two reasons combined explain why we don't feel pain at the exact time of injury.

"Australian rules football in the Middle East describes the minority sport of Australian rules football as it is watched and played in the Middle East region.

The sport is played at various levels, mainly by expatriate Australians.  The main cup competition played in the area is the Dubai 9s, although a regional league under the name AFL Middle East which commenced in October 2008, with the inaugural 2008/09 premiers being the Dubai Heat.  The AFLME initially featured six clubs, three in Dubai and one each from Abu Dhabi, Muscat and Doha.

Australian football is not known as a spectator sport in the Middle East.  The first Australian Football League exhibition match was played in the United Emirates in 2008.  The only matches broadcast are AFL matches (particularly the AFL Grand Final) on satellite television in some countries through the Australia Network and on cable television in Israel.

Bahrain
The Bahrain Blues were created in 2009, making their debut at the Dubai 9s tournament in that year.  They will enter the AFL Middle East as the league's seventh club for the season starting in October 2009.

Iraq
Servicemen, mostly Australians in Iraq played a game on ANZAC Day in 2008 in the colours of Essendon Bombers and Collingwood Magpies to celebrate The ANZAC Day clash.

Israel and Palestine

Australian Rules in Israel has been played sporadically since the 1980s.

The earliest mentions of the sport were in the mid-1980s. 

In the 1970s, there was no Aussie Rules, and expatriate Australian player David Stark took up rugby and playing in the lock position was part of the national rugby team in the 70s and 80s. 

By 1984 a small band of followers was noted to be playing informally in 1984 in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and Yerucham parks. In 1986, groups of 24 players from the British Olim Society gathered to play matches following viewing of television footage of the VFL Grand Final.

In 1995, when a group of around 20 players began regular social matches in Tel Aviv, although most of the players were based in Jerusalem.  By 2005 the community was still playing with around 70 players involved and discussion about creating a four-team league with sides from Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and various youth programs.  The majority of the playing base were the members of the Jewish community in Melbourne who have emigrated to Israel.

For political reasons Israel is affiliated with the European chapter of the AFL organisation and participates in its events.

A side representing Israel competed in both years of the Australian Football Multicultural Cup, winning the 2004 competition.

A team composed of Australian Jews resident in London competed as Israel in the 2005 EU Cup.

Highlights of the AFL Grand Final have been shown on Fox Sports Israel.

An idea to utilise the game Australian rules football as an instrument for forging peace between Israelis and Palestinians was suggested and carried out by Tanya Oziel of the Australian Jewish community in Sydney in late 2007.  

Consequently the AFL Peace Team project was created by Tanya Oziel and curated by Peres Center for Peace and Innovation. This team was composed mainly of basketball and soccer players and volunteers, trained from scratch in the first half of 2008 to participate in 2008 Australian Football International Cup that took place in August 2018 in Australia. The project received a wide support in Australian business, sport and social circles, including Australian Jewish businessman and Carlton Football Club president Dick Pratt and AFL legend Ron Barassi.

In early 2008 there were initially around 75 players in training for the team, which was cut back to around 26 (13 Israelis, 13 Palestinians) for the squad to attend the International Cup.  Match-day coach for the team at the tournament was former player Robert DiPierdomenico.

The Peace Team also returned for the Australian Football International Cup in 2011. The project ended shortly thereafter.

A few of the AFL Peace Team's graduates led by Yonatan Belik went on to establish the Jerusalem Peace Lions football club (JPL) in May 2015 continuing the peace effort. Team's management was actively recruiting both Israeli and Palestinian players residing in Jerusalem and surrounding areas. The club competed internationally representing Israel and the region in the 3 consecutive AFL Euro Cups 2015-2017.

In May 2018 a few former JPL players moved to Tel Aviv, and led by Shir Shalev started training in the HaYarkon park. In August 2018 they partnered with the sports platform OddBalls and formed the Tel Aviv Cheetahs football club. The Cheetahs and OddBalls are more focused on developing the sport itself rather than the activist work previously done by Peace Team and JPL, aiming to embed Australian rules football into Israeli cultural context and attract more local players. Prioritising the grassroots way of development the club's led to the club's squad being 3/4 Israeli. This allows the team to have a better chance at international European tournaments organised by AFL Europe, despite recent restrictions on the amount of Australian-born and raised participants allowed in the roster. Being the only active footy club in the region in 2018, the club went on to represent Israel internationally at the AFL Euro Cup 2018 in Cork, Ireland.

In May 2019 OddBalls and the Tel Aviv Cheetahs' management formed a national team, the Israeli Beasts, aiming to represent Israel in the AFL Euro Cup 2019 that will take place on 29 June in Sweden.

Lebanon
Australian Rules in Lebanon was first played around 2003 and 2004 in an attempt to introduce the sport into that country by members of the Lebanese community resident in Melbourne, this competition (based in Tripoli) has since gone into recess and there is no Australian rules currently played in Lebanon.

A team representing the Melbourne Lebanese community also competed at the Australian Football Multicultural Cup in both 2004, 2005, 2010 & 2011, winning the cup three times and then a fourth in 2014.

Team Lebanon was taken over by new president and head coach Rick Kerbatieh, who successfully coached the team to its fourth Harmony Cup in 2014 and is preparing the team for the World Cup in 2015. Rick has coached a record 10 grand final wins with team Lebanon.

Rick is currently head coach of the 2014 Pakistan Shaheens, who will compete in this year's 2014 AFL International Cup. 

Rick is currently looking at expanding the game in Lebanon once again and is working behind the scenes in an attempt to set up a Team Lebanon sporting academy.

Team Lebanon were the inaugural winners of the 2015 AFI World Cup, this bringing the total cups won to 10 now and rick being the most successful AFL Coach/President in the history of international teams.

In 2018, the inaugural Mediterranean Cup Team Lebanon came from behind to record an outstanding win.
  
as of now 2020 Rick decided to hand coaching reins over to Mohamad Kaakour who together with Rick as President brought home the inaugural ALL NATIONS CUP by being the underdog in the tournament and defeating favorite ITALY. 

some great players have worn the team Lebanon jumper and a team of teams will be announced at a dinner in upcoming times.

Oman
A group of players from Oman appeared at the 2007 Dubai 9s.  The Dubai Dingos followed the Dubai 9s by scheduling a match against the Omani side, which was partly composed of Gaelic football converts.  In 2008, the Muscat Magpies were formed as the country's first formal club.  The Magpies compete in the upcoming AFL Middle East.

Qatar
An Australian rules football club nicknamed the Kangaroos was founded in Doha, Qatar in early 2007, with their first appearance being at that year's Dubai 9s tournament. The Squad is made up of expatriate Australians.

The Doha Kangaroos were a founding member of the AFL Middle East.

United Arab Emirates
Australian Rules in the United Arab Emirates has been played since 2006, with the creation of a club in Dubai known as the Dubai Dingoes.  In addition to the senior team, there is junior football held weekly.  The club is mainly composed of expatriate Australians as well as Irish from the local gaelic football club.  The Dingoes held a 9-a-side international tournament in early 2007, also featuring teams from Abu Dhabi, Oman and Qatar.

A second and more successful club called the Dubai Heat was created as of 2007.

A team mainly drawn from the Dubai Heat, but also with some players from the Dubai Dingoes, represented the UAE at the 2007 Asian Australian Football Championships. In 2008 Dubai Heat entered another team in the Asian championships and successfully took the title beating the Singapore Wombats.

In February 2008, the first AFL match in the United Arab Emirates was held at the Ghantoot Polo and Racing Club in Abu Dhabi between the Adelaide Crows and the Collingwood Magpies.  It was one of few official NAB Cup matches played outside of Australia and the game attracted a sell-out crowd of 6,102 using a makeshift field and grandstand and was televised free-to-air in Australia.  The curtain raiser for the AFL match was played between the Dubai Dingos and Dubai Heat.

The Abu Dhabi Falcons and Dubai Dragons were formed in 2008 as the UAE's third and fourth clubs.

"Megaton is the name of several science fiction magazines published in Germany, Austria and Switzerland between 1974 and 2002.
History

The first Megaton was launched by publisher Karlheinz Hahn Verlag GmbH & Co KG on September 1, 1974 as a German-language version of French magazine Galaxie. The title changed to its current form when it moved from Paris to Munich after only one year. 
In 1977, the second issue appeared under new editor-in-chief Paul Gangelin who had been working at Galaxy International since 1973.  In 1981, he left his position there because of financial problems but continued editing Megaton until 1986.   He also edited other SF publications such as Fiction Express or Interzone.   
After that time, the editorial team consisted mainly of writers like Michael Moorcock,  Robert Silverberg  and Fritz Leiber .
From 1988 to 1992, the publication was taken over by another publishing house called Minotauro-Verlag which tried to revive interest in the series through special issues dedicated to authors like Philip K Dick , Terry Pratchett  , Roger Zelazny   and Brian W. Aldiss ."	1

The legal limit varies between countries; however, it's generally 0.08% blood alcohol concentration (BAC), meaning 80 milligrams per 100 milliliters of breath air.  Some jurisdictions have different limits depending upon whether you're over 21 years old.  For example, New York City has separate BAC levels based on age ranging from .025% - .035% for drivers ages 18-20, .05%-.07% for those aged 20-30, and .10%-.12% for people 30-40.  Other states use weight-based measures instead such as grams of alcohol per deciliter of blood (g/dL).

The economy of most countries around the globe will be affected negatively, as there is less money being spent and produced by people working to make things that are sold at stores or online shops. This could cause many companies to go out of business because they don't have enough income from sales to pay their bills (rent/mortgage/utilities) and/or employees' wages/salaries. The government may also lose tax revenue due to fewer workers paying taxes into it. There might even be riots over food shortages caused by not having anyone producing anything anymore! Many businesses won't survive without customers spending money on products made available through them. Some jobs cannot be done remotely such as: doctors/nurses who work with patients; police officers responding to emergencies etc., so those types of jobs wouldn't exist either which means more deaths occur than usual during this time period. People would riot over food shortages? Yes, but only temporarily	1

"The authors present in this work ""Paleo"" which stands for ""Performance Analysis of Learning"". The idea behind this approach is to provide a tool able to predict performances of different architectures (and thus algorithms) when deployed over clusters/grids.

"""She Knows Me Too Well"" is a song written by Brian Wilson and Mike Love for the American rock band The Beach Boys, about a man who is engrossed and obsessed in his own jealousy and insecurity. It was released on the 1965 album The Beach Boys Today!, initially serving as the B-side of their ""When I Grow Up (To Be a Man)"" single in 1964.  It was one of the first songs that Brian wrote while under the influence of marijuana.

Composition
Brian considered the song a tribute to Burt Bacharach. According to Allmusic, ""This song can essentially be called 'son of ""Don't Worry Baby"".' It's built around the same kinds of Spector-inspired chord changes and also has a similar sense of vulnerability."" According to PopMatters,

Interpreting its lyrics,

David Leaf believed the song ""is another of the important musical developments on the road to Pet Sounds, and in retrospect, hearing this in 1965 might have felt very strange … almost like you were hearing a cut from Pet Sounds a year before that album even existed."" He also notes that it was ""a gorgeous production, but it took a little while to get used to, probably because the bittersweet chord changes and harmonies were more sophisticated than the typical pop ballad of the day.""

Recording
The song was recorded over two sessions at United Western Recorders in early August, both engineered by Chuck Britz and produced by Brian Wilson: the first session for the instrumental track took place on August 5 in tandem with ""When I Grow Up (To Be a Man)""; three days later, the vocals were recorded. They are doubletracked, just as they are on most Beach Boys songs. The instrumental track features Carl Wilson on both lead and rhythm electric guitars, Alan Jardine on electric bass guitar, Brian Wilson on acoustic upright piano, and Dennis Wilson on drums. The song features Brian Wilson on lead vocal and Brian, Carl & Dennis Wilson, Mike Love, and Al Jardine on backing vocals.

On the Unsurpassed Masters Vol. 7 (1964): The Alternate ""Beach Boys Today"" Album Vol. 1 bootleg, various recording sessions were released in high quality. Four takes of the instrumental track (plus rehearsals) were released on this bootleg, as well as two backing vocal overdubs and Brian's lead vocal overdub.

Release
In August 1964, ""She Knows Me Too Well"" was released in the United States as the B-side of the ""When I Grow Up (To Be a Man)"" single. The single, the band's tenth in the United States, peaked at number nine position on the Billboard charts, with ""She Knows Me Too Well"" in its own right placing at number 101 in Billboard and number 93 in Cash Box. The song was treated as the A-side at Vancouver's popular CFUN station and reached number seven locally.

The song was also released in the United Kingdom, again as the B-side of the ""When I Grow Up (To Be a Man)"" single, which was the band's sixth there. The single didn't fare as well, but still peaked at number 27 on the charts.

Cash Box described it as ""a captivating cha cha beat romancer that's...sure to please the kids.""

American rock band Stone Temple Pilots recorded a cover version of the song during the sessions for their 1994 album Purple. This version of the song was included on the band's 2019 ""Super Deluxe"" version of the album.

You may also choose other shapes like cylinders etc..     If you're not familiar with Blender yet I suggest starting off with something simple like cubes before moving onto more complicated things.      Once you've made one shape you'll need to give them some properties so they behave correctly when animating.       Go back to Edit mode    and set the object's name to whatever you'd like.

"  We develop a ""chain-boson model"" master equation, within the Born-Markov
approximation, for a few superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs)
coupled into a chain and exchanging their angular momenta with a low
temperature phonon bath. Our master equation has four generators; we
concentrate on the damping and diffusion and use them to study the relaxation
and decoherence of a Heisenberg SQUID chain whose spectrum exhibits critical
point energy-level crossings, entangled states, and pairs of resonant
transitions. We note that at an energy-level crossing the relevant bath
wavelengths are so long that even well-spaced large SQUIDs can partially
exhibit collective coupling to the bath, dramatically reducing certain
relaxation and decoherence rates. Also, transitions into entangled states can
occur even in the case of an independent coupling of each SQUID to the bath.
Finally, the pairs of resonant transitions can cause decaying oscillations to
emerge in a lower energy subspace.

" Take off the cap and wash it. Cut the bottom, and along the sides. This will create a flat sheet. It is okay if the sides are somewhat jagged, as you will trim it later. Once you have the flat sheet, roll it backwards along the table to undo the curve the can naturally has.;
, Cut that rectangle out and trim any jagged edges still there. Be very careful not to cut yourself. Recycle the other pieces.

, If it helps, fold it along a ruler. Unfold after you've done this.

, Cut along these lines and trim the pieces that hand off. You should have one half being 6cm x 9cm and the other being 4cm x 8cm.

, Line two edges of the smaller edge with this Blu-Tac, then flatten it out slightly.

, Press the Blu-Tac under the metal. Next, line the top of the piece you just folded over with more Blu-Tac, directly over the other bead of Blu-Tac.

, Be gentle, making sure to not tear the metal. If possible, use small pliers.

, It is not very important for the edge to be perfectly straight, but it helps a lot if it is. It should now be approximately 9cm long and 4cm wide.

, If necessary, fold it in half then flatten it.

, Wrap the first one so it is completely covered twice, then add the second straw, continuing to wrap the Blu-Tac around both straws until the Blu-Tac is used up. Make sure to add enough Blu-Tac so that the straws are well-secured by a good plug of Blu-Tac.

, Add some more Blu-Tac until it forms a good seal. Remember the Goldilocks principle: not too much, not too little.

, Fold the two outer pieces up, and squeeze them with the pliers. Add any needed Blu-Tac.

,


Test that it is airtight by putting it underwater and blowing. If you see any bubbles, give that area a gentle squeeze with the pliers and try again.

, Leave the top closed when you do this. If it opens using the carton itself, use the end that is not open. If it uses a bottle top, use the side without the bottle top.

, Cut out any Windows, and decorate it as you see fit. Put aside the cabin to attach later with glue, tape or Blu-Tac, attach the 'cabin' to the boat.

, It may be easier to cut this part with a knife. If desired, twist the knife around in the hole to scrape the edges so they are smooth.

,, Snip off any extra that extends past the end of the boat.

, Once you have successfully taped the straws to the bottom, cover the hole on both sides with Blu-Tac. Quickly test the boat to see if it's watertight. If not, add more Blu-Tac.

, Attach it with glue, tape or Blu-Tac. Your boat and cabin are now complete.

, You can also do it by sucking water into your mouth. Once prepped, tape the straw back to the boat.

, After a few moments, the boat will being to move forward in the water and make its signature popping sound.

"We report on the observation and analysis of molecular bound states in ultracold cesium atoms trapped by an optical lattice potential. The molecules are created using magnetic field induced Feshbach resonances at temperatures below 1 microkelvin. We measure their binding energies as functions of both magnetic field strength and laser intensity. These measurements allow us to determine the scattering length between two fermionic atoms with high precision. In addition we observe that the molecule formation rate is strongly enhanced when the trapping lasers are detuned into resonance with excited vibrational levels of the atomic ground state. This effect can be explained by stimulated emission processes which lead to rapid relaxation towards deeply bound molecular states. Finally we demonstrate how these results can be used for precise determination of the s-wave scattering lengths between different spin species. Our work opens up new possibilities for studying quantum many-body phenomena such as superfluidity or supersolidity in systems of interacting fermions. 
 
 We present experimental data obtained during our study of ultracold cesium (Cs) atoms confined within an optical lattice trap. Using magnetic field induced Feshback resonances we create weakly bound Cs2 dimer molecules out of pairs of fermionic atoms. By measuring the binding energy of the molecules as function of magnetic field strength and laser power density we obtain accurate values for the scattering length between two Cs atoms. Furthermore we find that the molecule formation process is strongly enhanced if the trapping lasers have a frequency close to one of the atomic transitions. This effect can be understood by considering stimulated emission processes leading to fast relaxation towards deeply bound molecular levels."	1
Sealed with pitch and tar, which was applied to planks of wood before they were nailed together into ship hulls. The hull would then be covered by layers of oakum (a mixture of shredded rope or cloth) that had been soaked in oil.  This method is still used today on small boats such as kayaks. It also works well when combined with modern techniques like fiberglass coating. Sealing with pitch and tar has several disadvantages including toxicity problems if it leaks out onto crew members' skin during use; this can cause severe burns similar to those caused by lighter fluid.   Pitching and tarring are not done anymore because new methods have developed since the 19th century using synthetic materials instead of natural ones.

"  Plasma pressure distribution in the inner magnetosphere is one of the key
parameters for understanding the main magnetospheric processes including
geomagnetic storms and substorms. However, the pressure profiles obtained from
in-situ particle measurements by the high-altitude satellites do not allow
tracking the pressure variations related to the storms and substorms, because a
time interval needed to do this generally exceeds the characteristic times of
them. On contrary, fast movement of low-altitude satellites makes it possible
to retrieve quasi-instantaneous profiles of plasma pressure along the satellite
trajectory, using the fluxes of precipitating particles. For this study, we
used the Aureol-3 satellite data for plasma pressure estimation, and the IGRF,
Tsyganenko 2001 and Tsyganenko 2004 storm time geomagnetic field models for the
pressure mapping into the equatorial plane. It was found that during quiet
geomagnetic condition the radial pressure profiles obtained coincide with the
profiles, obtained previously from the high-altitude measurements. On the
contrary, it was found that during geomagnetic storm the plasma pressure
profiles became sharper; the position of the maximum of plasma pressure
corresponds to expected one for given Dst minimum; the maximum value of inner
magnetosphere static pressure correlates with the solar wind dynamic pressure.
Increase in the plasma pressure profiles indicates the possibility to consider
the interchange instability as one of important factors for the development of
the main phase of geomagnetic storm.

"They cannot enter it at all because of its gravity and density. They will just pass right through as if nothing were there. Black holes have no effect on them whatsoever! This is why we call them ""black"" - you can't see anything inside one that isn't already visible outside (like stars). The only thing that could possibly get pulled in would be something with some kind of gravitational pull like matter or energy but not light. Light has absolutely zero weight so it's impossible to suck any part of it up by itself. It doesn't even need an object around which to orbit before being attracted towards another body's gravity field; this means there's literally nowhere else for it to go once it leaves your hand other than straight back out again. If you're standing next to someone who weighs 200 pounds then you'll feel their weight pulling down upon you while they're doing exactly the same thing to you too. But when you hold onto a ball that's floating freely between both hands it'll float away from either side equally without anyone having more control over where it goes than the other person does."	1
"The authors present an interesting idea on using dialogues for training machine-learning models. The experiments are well designed but there is no discussion about whether their approach could be applied beyond movies (e.g., real-world applications). This may limit its practicality as it would require more data collection efforts than those presented here. 
 
 Strengths: 
1) They use simulated environments instead of collecting new datasets which makes it easier to experiment. 
2) Their results show promise towards building intelligent machines capable of interacting naturally via conversations. 

Weaknesses: 
1) No discussions regarding possible future directions/applications outside of movies were mentioned. (This might not necessarily be considered a weakness.) 
 
 
 
 2) There was little mention made if any other research has been done along these lines before they started working on this project."	1
" especially the section about physically removing the starter from the engine compartment. This should help you decide whether to take the vehicle into service vs doing this yourself.
,, You will be in and under the wheel well most of the time., you can remove the plastic rivets with a large screwdriver or stretch the rubber guards over the heads of the rivets., (just aft of the strut). The starter will not fit through this space without moving this brake line first., It is held in place by an O ring. twist and pull the upper section up. It comes out reasonably easy, plug the top of the bottom section with a paper towel as to not contaminate the transmission fluid.,, You will have to go under the truck and come in from behind the starter through a maze of brake lines etc. The swivel headed ratchet makes this job MUCH easier. Using a 12 to 14 inch (30.5 to 35.6 cm) extension and the same 14mm socket and swivel ratchet remove the top bolt., Depress the plastic locking key and slide the plug out. Fortunately this removed easy, because there is little room to maneuver and no room to use pliers. If you had to use force there is no room for leverage., THIS IS THE MOST DIFFICULT PART OF THE JOB. I was unable to do it myself and ended up having a Toyota Service supervisor come to my home and assist me. He said only two of his three techs are able to perform this task. The starter needs to be removed gears first, through the wheel well opening, it needs to be lifted (gears up) and rotated toward the opening so that it is removed not quite horizontally. As the starter is moved toward the opening it has to be rotated so the positive battery lead bolt can clear obstructions. The starter is then advanced in position and rotated opposite direction. Advance the starter in position and wiggle it in position until it can be removed. This is MUCH more difficult than it sounds. As I said I was unable to perform this task., You will need an impact driver to take the starter apart and check the bushes (also called lunge contacts). The brushes are usually just over an inch long and spring-loaded, if they appear to have plenty of carbon left then look to your stator. Bluish burns on the copper windings indicate bad spots, and the starter should be replaced. As difficult as this job was, replacing the starter is worth every dime. After market starters are approx. $100. Toyota I believe is closer to $300., wiggle it around until it goes into the engine compartment, maneuver the starter until the gears go into the flywheel housing then line it up and push it into place. It is difficult to tell whether the gears and flywheel mesh, but rotate the starter back and forth and the gears should mesh. Using a 12–14 inch (30.5–35.6 cm) flat piece of anything, prop the starter up so that you may start the bolts into the starter housing. I had better success with the lower bolt first, and pulling the starter up to the flywheel housing cautiously to check the gear mesh. Leave the lower bolt loose and start the top bolt. After re-installing the starter, I had difficulty tightening this top bolt. I was able to reach this bolt through the wheel well (with no extension or flex socket) for final tightening. Tighten the bolts checking the gap between the flywheel housing and the starter to ensure the gears meshed properly. If they are coming together unevenly remove either bolt, loosen the other bolt and rotate the starter back and forth until it goes into place. The limited access to the starter makes this process more difficult because of lack of mobility of the starter. Repeat the re-bolting process, and tighten down the bolts. I do not know the torque values if any. I use the tight is tight, too tight is broke, method., Rebolt the brake line bracket, replace the negative battery lead and start the truck. If the truck starts, shut it off, remove the jack stands, replace the wheel, remove the jack and tighten down the wheel bolts."	0

"James Kazama (丘占輝 (Chinese), カザマ ジェイムス (Japanese), also 占士•卡查馬 is a Thai movie and television actor, dubbing artist, fashion model, contemporary calligraphy artist, installation art artist, pop-rock vocalist, and a licensed nutritionist. Kazama speaks English, French, Cantonese, Japanese, Thai, Mandarin, Spanish, German, and Chaozhou.

Early life

Kazama was born on 19 June in Hong Kong, the son of a land developer father and a garment factory director mother. Kazama grew up both in Hong Kong and Bangkok.

Asian professional career
In 1996, Kazama's voiceover potential was discovered by Lo Hung, a well known dubbing artist in Hong Kong, via an introduction by his sister Bonny, a former dubbing artist in Hong Kong. Years later, Kazama provided voiceovers in many well-known Asian movies, TV series, and animations, including the character Dr. Zoidberg in the Cantonese version of Futurama.

In 1999, Kazama entered the semi-final of a karaoke singing contest in Thailand. He is also a former vocalist in pop-rock cover band Hotfever.

Kazama has been in theatre since 1997, spending many of these years in Hong Kong. In 2001, Kazama's theatre group Drama2 破簡坊 had its first performance with the play “Come Try Again!” (來Try Again!), with Kazama in the leading role as “Ah-Sai” (阿細).  Each show had a full house and additional seats were added due to demand from the public. The production received critical praise from audience members. Later in the year, Kazama was invited by Home Theatre Home (劇場休舔間) to join the play Man Murdered Nature Murdered Man (人謀殺自然謀殺人), directed by Mike Chow. This play won the Outstanding Team Play Award and Outstanding Director Award at the Hong Kong Federation of Drama Societies 2001 awards.

In 2001, Kazama starred as “Man” in a documentary, “Sexual Harassment Awareness” for the Hong Kong Polytechnic University.

Kazama is also a chef. In 2002, Kazama and his associates opened La Fu, a private restaurant in Hong Kong. Kazama was the main chef for the restaurant, which received positive reviews for its creativity and Kazama's traditional gourmet dishes.

Life in Europe
In 2004, Kazama left for Montpellier in southern France, despite not speaking much French. A few months later, he relocated to the Belgian capital, Brussels.

In 2005, Kazama joined the non-profit organization Nativitas in Brussels. He took on the role of main chef at their restaurant social scheme, providing warm hospitality and creatively prepared meals to people with various life difficulties. He commented in local interviews, ""No matter whether they're rich people or poor people, they all have the right to have warm and delicious meals!""

In 2008, Kazama was invited by a young Belgian film director, Xavier Nellens, to be cast in a Belgian feature Gloria Jesus. Kazama won the role of Pastor Chang, and due to his outstanding performance, Kazama even gained Pastor Chang an extra background scene in the film. He subsequently traveled to different countries for the location shootings of Gloria Jesus, both in the role of Pastor Chang and as an assistant director. The same year, Kazama established his first abstract painting calligraphy exhibition in Brussels with his new series, Lights and Shadows. His paintings received high praises from visitors throughout Europe.

Kazama also appeared in Valencia and Horchata in Spain, in productions of his Spanish associate Oscar Corrons NOPfilms.

In 2009, Kazama was invited to exhibit his contemporary calligraphy and installation art at ETNIK'Art, in the eastern Belgian city of Liège. His paintings once again received positive feedback from the public, and his work Scream of Time was posted on the Liège City Blog as the cover picture of the exhibition. Later that year, Kazama was invited to star as an aggressive Zen master for a RTBF (Radio Télévision Belge de la Communauté Française) program, and appeared in a variety show, J’ai Pigé.

In 2010, Kazama appeared in the fashion show of a Belgian popular fashion brand, Bellrose, in the northern Belgian city of Antwerp; he was also chosen as a leading model for their catalogue in 2010. Later that year, Kazama was invited by Belgian film director Toon Aerts to guest star in the music video for Beyond Repair by The Sore Losers.

In 2011, Kazama appeared in the 2nd season of the program ""À tort ou à raison"" on RTBF (Radio Télévision Belge de la Communauté Française). He also appeared in a Belgian feature film, L'envahisseur (English Title: The Invader), as Liong Bing, a passionate artist. This film won the Georges Delerue Prize and Special Mention awards, and was also nominated for the Grand Prix at the Ghent International Film Festival 2011.

In 2012, Kazama starred in the crime thriller Le Jour Attendra (Paris Countdown), directed by Edgar Marie, with Jacques Gamblin, Olivier Marchal, Rada Kateb, and Carlo Brandt.

In 2013, Kazama was invited to participate in a street art project, ""Piano en ville,"" which was hosted by La Commune Saint-Gilles, Brussels. Kazama created an installation artwork called ""Golden Baby,"" which was well-received by the City of Brussels and the public.

" For the purpose of this guide, we’ll call the router that’s connected to the Internet “Router 1” and the new router “Router 2.”;
, To configure routers, you’ll need a computer that can connect to them via an Ethernet cable or Wi-Fi. The operating system of the computer doesn’t matter.


If you’ll be using Wi-Fi to connect to the routers, take note of the SSID and passkey for each router. You’ll need this information to connect to each router via Wi-Fi.

, If you plan to connect computers and other devices to the network without Wi-Fi, you’ll need an Ethernet cable for each device.


For example, you’ll need one Ethernet cable to connect Router 2 to Router 1.
If you wanted to connect two additional computers to the network, have additional Ethernet cables available for each device (unless you plan to connect them via Wi-Fi).

,, You’ll want to start wiring the network with the equipment turned off.

,


The WAN port may be labeled “Internet.”

,


If you’d prefer to connect the computer to the router wirelessly, use your router’s instructions to do so.

, Wait a few moments for them both to come back up.

, You’ll need a web browser to connect to the admin interface of Router 1.

, This address is printed somewhere on Router 1.


Here are some default IP addresses for common router brands:

2Wire: 192.168.1.1, 192.168.0.1, 192.168.1.254, 10.0.0.138
Apple: 10.0.0.1
Belkin: 192.168.1.1, 192.168.2.1, 10.0.0.2, 10.1.1.1
Dlink: 192.168.1.1, 192.168.0.1, 192.168.0.101, 192.168.0.30, 192.168.0.50, 192.168.15.1, 192.168.254.254, 192.168.1.254, 192.168.0.10, 192.168.15.1, 10.0.0.1, 10.0.0.2, 10.1.1.1, 10.90.90.90,
Netgear: 192.168.0.1, 192.168.0.227, These credentials, like the IP address, can be found printed on Router 1.


If there is no username and password combination printed on your router, search the internet for “default router password for ”.
If you’re using the right password but still can’t connect, reset the router to its default settings by inserting the end of a paperclip into its “reset” port.,


The DHCP settings are located in different places across different types of routers, but you’ll usually find them under “Network settings,” or “LAN settings.”
In most cases, the DHCP server is turned on by default.

, Visit any website (like https://www.wikihow.com) to verify that you can connect to the Internet. Make sure that the physical configuration of your network leaves room for one LAN port to be open on Router 1.

, Everything else can remain on and plugged in.

, Now you’ll configure Router 2 as a second router on the same subnet. This means all devices on the network will be able to access each other.

,, Just as when you logged into Router 1 as an administrator, you’ll need to do this to Router 2. Log in to the router’s admin interface using your credentials. Check and see what the IP is; most routers default to 192.168.0.1, 192.168.1.1, or 10.0.0.1.

, Locate the DHCP settings (as you did earlier for Router 1) and switch the DHCP server to “Off.”

, That needs to change.


Find the area in the router admin website called “LAN” or “Local Network.” There should be a blank that contains the current IP address (the one you connected to in your web browser).
Type a new IP address in place of the existing one. The new address must be on the same subnet as Router 1, meaning the first three sets of numbers (out of four) in the IP address must be the same as Router 1. It also can’t be an IP currently assigned to another device.
If Router 1’s IP address is 192.168.0.1, for example, Router 2 can be 192.168.0.100. Since the computer is the only other device on the network, there’s little risk for an IP address conflict.

, If it is, assign it the same SSID (the name of the Wi-Fi access point) and passkey as Router 1.


You should find these settings under a menu called something like “Wireless” or “Wi-Fi setup.”
If you’re unsure of Router 1’s SSID and passkey, it should be printed on the device.

, Now that Router 2’s all set up, it’s a good idea to give it a restart—though, for now, leave the power unplugged instead of turning it right back on.

, Make sure you’re not plugging it into the WAN port (they look similar).

, When the router comes back up, it will have the IP address you configured. As long as Router 1 has Internet access, Router 2 will now also be online.

,, Router 1’s DHCP server will automatically assign each device its own IP address in the same subnet. Enjoy your expanded network!

"There are  already a lot of well-intentioned but misinformed responses here.

The little-known fact is that the famous E = m c^2 is universal, not at all just confined to exotic particles.

As a result, any and all conversions of energy convert *some* (usually tiny) amount of mass into energy:

 >  Another example is hydroelectric generation. The electrical energy produced by Grand Coulee Dam's turbines every 3.7 hours represents one gram of mass. This mass passes to electrical devices (such as lights in cities) powered by the generators, where it appears as a gram of heat and light.[35] Turbine designers look at their equations in terms of pressure, torque, and RPM. However, Einstein's equations show that all energy has mass, and thus the electrical energy produced by a dam's generators, and the resulting heat and light, all retain their mass—which is equivalent to the energy. The potential energy—and equivalent mass—represented by the waters of the Columbia River as it descends to the Pacific Ocean would be converted to heat due to viscous friction and the turbulence of white water rapids and waterfalls were it not for the dam and its generators. This heat would remain as mass on site at the water, were it not for the equipment that converted some of this potential and kinetic energy into electrical energy, which can move from place to place (taking mass with it).

Even burning a candle converts matter into energy. We've all been influenced so strongly by science fiction in movies that we think of exotic phenomenon, but what Einstein discovered is even more remarkable precisely because it also applies to the mundane."	0

"South Gare Lighthouse was built in 1884 at the end of the breakwater at South Gare north west of Redcar in North Yorkshire and in north eastern England.

History 
There already were two navigation light towers built in 1829 and operating in Durham county at Seaton Carew and another at Hartlepool to guide ships clear of Coatham Rocks off Redcar and then onto the Fairway Buoy outside the bar of the River Tees. The building of South Gare lighthouse was planned and supervised by John Fowler, engineer to the Tees Conservancy Commissioners. Both light systems were used until 1892 when use of the light towers at Seaton Carew was discontinued by the Tees Conservancy Commissioners.

The South Gare lighthouse light was originally lit by a paraffin wick lamp.
and perhaps subsequently by a pressurised paraffin burner. This was removed in 1955, and in about 1980 the chimney and weather vane were removed.
The paraffin lamp was replaced by a mains powered 500 Watt tungsten filament Incandescent light bulb with a backup bulb on the bulb changer that operated with a backup diesel generator. The light operated with a 1.5 s flash every 12 seconds. The lens rotation mechanism was originally powered by a clockwork motor but this was replaced by two electric motors, i.e. one duty motor and a backup motor. A fog signal was mounted to the west of the lighthouse but this has evidently been removed. The light source was a 35 Watt CDM-T lamp until 2007 when it was replaced by a 45 Watt high intensity LED lamp.

Description 
The lighthouse is  high with a cylindrical cast iron clad stone tower all painted white. Small porthole windows in the north and south side of the column light an internal helical newel staircase.

The light source is held in the original eight windowed lantern housing under a hemispherical copper domed roof. Below the windows there is a railed circular platform supported by brackets. The current light source is a 45 Watt high intensity LED with a fourth order prismatic lens and can be seen for a range of . Set  above mean high water the light operates automatically exhibiting sectored red and white with a 0.5 s flash every 12 seconds with an effective intensity of 150,000 Candelas. The light is powered by a Schlunk 100 Watt water-cooled hydrogen fuel cell a world first. This arrangement is more reliable than the mains electricity supply along the exposed breakwater because of its vulnerability in storms.

The lighthouse is a listed building and still operates using the original lenses. Today the lighthouse is owned and operated by PD Ports, and has the Admiralty code A2626, NGA code 2020, and Amateur Radio Lighthouse Society (ARLHS) code ENG-131. The lighthouse can give status broadcasts using radio telemetry with the callsign G0SBN/P.

The air is compressed and then released, creating an audible shock wave that travels faster than the speed of sound in normal conditions (340 m/s). The higher the aircraft flies above sea level, the more likely it will break through this limit at some point during its flight path. This causes the loud noise heard as a sonic boom when flying over land or water. Airplanes fly much slower than 340m/s so they don't usually reach Mach 1 unless they're very high up. When planes do get to Mach 1, it's because they've been traveling fast enough already before reaching their cruising altitude. Because the plane has reached such great speeds by now, there isn't any extra energy needed to push them past Mach 1. It's just like pushing on your car's accelerator pedal - if you have plenty of momentum going into a turn, there's no need to put additional pressure behind the wheel. Answer not in context	1
"Party Headquarters is a Bulgarian novel by Georgi Tenev, awarded with Vick Foundation Award for Novel of the Year (2007). The plot revolves around the changes following the collapse of the Communist Regime in Bulgaria. The novel addresses the emblematic events of the 1980s and the 1990s – the Chernobyl disaster, the anticommunist protests, the arson attack over the Communist Party Headquarters in Sofia. It deals with typologically set associations such as the symbolic use of Georgi Dimitrov's Mausoleum in the plot. To a great extent, this is no historical account but a book about the traumas of totalitarian conscience, about politics interweaving with sexuality.

Reception

“Party Headquarters affected me personally. We still carry within ourselves the attitudes of socialism – subordination and privileges, forcible eroticism, the rule of partocracy. […] Socialism is not over. We live in it even now. […] The book is brilliant, with icy threads running in the ink. […] We fellow writers prefer keeping silence about Chernobyl, the fire in the Party Headquarters, the Pioneer camps; at best we turn our stories into exportable pamphlets. Tenev has managed to break open forbidden locks.”	
(Marin Bodakov Culture )

“Black irony, the use of lexicon format, the documentary reminders – all this makes Party Headquarters one of the most influential books of the recent times. Reading this novel prevents us from cancelling the memories and from betraying our desire for freedom.”
(Amelia Licheva Capital Light)

“Party Headquarters interprets a deeply personal story where the private, the intimate, is publicly exposed. 
The success of Party Headquarters is most probably due to the peculiar topics and to the clear and easy to apprehend language of the writer.”
(Maria Popova Politics)

" Speak to your pastor about your interest in becoming ordained. If your pastor supports your goal, you will be brought before a local board at your church. This board or committee will ask you questions about your interest in becoming ordained.


You might be rejected if you express a mystical belief that God has chosen you to become ordained, if you suggest or imply that ordination would simply be a personal accomplishment, if you have few other professional options or have been unsuccessful in their professional life, or if you demonstrate an inadequate understanding about the purpose of ministry. You will also likely be rejected if you have a criminal history.
To be accepted as a candidate for ordination, express a willingness to serve the church and congregation, demonstrate that you are personable and have strong people skills, and show that you are willing to work hard.
Report back to the board periodically about progress you’ve made toward becoming ordained.
Be completely honest with your church committee.

, After passing the initial interview, the church might assign you a spiritual mentor -- an elder in the church or another person with strong faith -- to help guide you through the ordination process. If you are allowed to choose from a number of different potential mentors, select someone who you can communicate easily and honestly with who will keep you energized and focused throughout the ordination process., You will receive a Master of Divinity degree from a seminary accredited by the Association of Theological Schools. You could, alternately, obtain a Master of Arts in theology, though this is not preferred.


You do not need to attend a seminary explicitly associated with your denomination.
If you do not like your seminary, talk to your mentor and church committee about transferring to another seminary.

, You will engage in part-time work to gain practical experience as part of the clergy. In addition to the internship, a shorter period of internship called a practicum may be required. Check your seminary’s graduation requirements for specifics.

, You will also need to undertake sex-abuse training to identify and understand sexual abuse. Use training materials provided by the seminary to prepare for these tests.


You might also be given psychological and personality tests.

, You should also include some information about a specific topic or topics relevant to your ordination. For instance, you might write the main body of your ordination paper on a topic like “forgiveness in the Old Testament.”


The specific format of your ordination paper depends on the requirements of your seminary program.

, Some denominations like the United Methodists and Evangelicals have a probationary period for their pastors. You might need to rack up four years or more of ministry experience before you are properly ordained.During this trial period, find your own voice at the pulpit and gain more experience in helping, preaching, and providing inspiration to your community of believers.
Continue learning more about your role in the church and deepening your knowledge of the Bible through daily reading and reflection.

, You will also need to present personal references, some or all of which are from other pastors, deacons, or church elders. Talk to your mentor about the process in your church.

"  We consider 5D braneworld models of quasi-localized gravity in which 4D
gravity is reproduced at intermediate scales while the extra dimension opens up
at both the very short and the very long distances, where the geometry is flat.
Our main interest is the interplay between the zero mode of these models,
whenever a normalizable zero mode exists, and the effects of zero energy
graviton resonant modes coming from the contributions of massive KK modes. We
first consider a compactified version of the GRS model and find that
quasi-localized gravity is characterized by a scale for which both the
resonance and the zero mode have significant contribution to 4D gravity. Above
this scale, gravity is primarily mediated by the zero mode, while the resonance
gives only minor corrections. Next, we consider an asymmetric version of the
standard non-compact GRS model, characterized by different cosmological
constants on each AdS side. We show that a resonance is present but the
asymmetry, through the form of the localizing potential, can weaken it,
resulting in a shorter lifetime and, thus, in a shorter distance scale for 4D
gravity. As a third model exhibiting quasi-localization, we consider a version
of the GRS model in which the central positive tension brane has been replaced
by a configuration of a scalar field propagating in the bulk.

People are thirsty when they urinate darkly, which leads them to think they're not getting enough fluids in their diet. This myth has been debunked by scientists who have found no correlation between color of urine and hydration levels.  The human body can store up to four liters (1 gallon) of liquid before needing to be replenished from food or drink sources.   People with darker skin may also produce more concentrated urine than those with lighter colored skin due to higher amounts of melanin present in the urine. No scientific evidence exists proving this theory. Scientists have found no correlation between colors of urine and hydration levels; however some studies show that dehydration does cause an increase in urinary concentration as well as decrease in volume produced per unit time. Some studies suggest that dehydrated individuals will produce less urine but more concentrated urine; therefore making the urine appear darker	1
You can have seizures and die from them if you do not wake up soon enough. You may also experience other complications such as headaches, nausea or vomiting. If your brain does not get oxygenated blood quickly then this could cause permanent damage that will be difficult to reverse later on in life. The longer time between when someone falls into unconsciousness until they are revived by CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) increases their chances of death. This means that even though there was no loss of consciousness during an accident where one person fell down stairs but another had a severe blow to his/her head causing him/her to lose consciousness immediately afterwards would mean that the latter has more chance of dying than the former because he/she took much less time before losing consciousness. Because people who suffer from concussions often feel dizzy and/or nauseous following the injury, falling asleep while still feeling these symptoms makes it very hard to wake back up again	1
You will lose your assets and possessions to pay off creditors, unless they are exempt from seizure by law or have been paid in full before filing. You may also be required to repay some of what you've already spent on credit cards if it is considered unsecured debt (not backed up with collateral). If you're not able to make payments after bankruptcy then you'll likely get another foreclosed property.  Bankruptcies can take years to complete as well. The process begins at an official meeting called a 341 hearing where all parties gather together including trustees who represent creditors' interests.   At this point, you must disclose any information about yourself that could affect how much money you owe such as:  Your income sources; Any other debts owed; Property owned outside of mortgages; Other liabilities like student loans etc... Once filed, there are several steps involved which include:   A personal interview with a trustee appointed by the court; Meeting with a financial advisor; Attending classes designed to help you learn budgeting; Receiving monthly payment checks based upon your disposable income;	1
" Do you want him or her to change for you? And if so, consider that it would be fair for your partner to want you to change for them as well. Another thing you can try is to fully accept whatever it is you want them to change. Say it aloud: ""I accept that he/she is a total slob."" Then ask yourself: Do the benefits of the relationship outweigh that fact? If so, try accepting and dealing with your partner as they are, rather than trying to change them.


If this is something so big or bothersome that you simply can't get over it and the person won't change, then it may be time to end the relationship.
Maybe you and your partner come from different religious backgrounds. If your partner refuses to convert and so do you and religion is very important to you, then this may indeed be a deal breaker for you.;
, You may discover that you want to break up because you don't want to face certain issues in yourself, like insecurity or fear of abandonment, but they are sure to turn up in any relationship you're in. For example, maybe you've been cheated on before, and you're tempted to break up with this person before you get too attached and become vulnerable to being deeply hurt again. That's not a good reason to break up. You need to address your fears, rather than run away from them.


If you think your issues are the problem, then talk to your partner about them and see if you can find a way to work through them together.

, If you're the kind of person who's used to looking out for everyone else's needs, maybe deep down you know you don't want to be in this relationship, but you're scared of telling the person it's over. You have to realize, however, that you're not doing this person any favors by staying with them out of sympathy. Reading How to Stop Being a People Pleaser might help.


If you know that the relationship has no real future for you, then ending it as quickly as possible will be the best thing you can do for your partner, because you'll be giving him or her the chance to heal and find a more fitting relationship in the future.
Though it's ideal to end the relationship during a calm time, don't keep holding off because of a birthday, a wedding, Valentine's Day, Christmas with your family, or a million other reasons that would make it ""inconvenient"" to be broken up. This can go on forever and there is no perfect time to end a relationship (though some are, of course, better than others).

, Are you scared of being single? Another reason sometimes people are reluctant to end a relationship is because they don't want to be alone. But staying with someone as a ""placeholder"" is not only unfair to them, but also unfair to yourself, because then you're less likely to develop as an individual and find the right person for you. Read How to Enjoy Being Single and How to Be Optimistic for encouragement.

, Or, maybe they're just not all that into you. No one knows exactly why we like or love the people we do. Sometimes we just don't connect. Or sometimes one person develops strong feelings, and the other doesn't. It happens. And it hurts, but it's not anyone's fault. Affection and love can't be forced. You might have been madly in love at some point, but how long ago was that? The sooner you admit how you really feel, the sooner you can do something about it.

, Spend some time sitting alone with your eyes closed, focusing on your breath. Though this may not lead to an epiphany about what you should do about your relationship, it can help you feel centered and more in touch with your thoughts. You may be too busy panicking that you haven't had a moment to sit down and really listen to what your mind and body are telling you.

, This is an important point. If your work or group of friends are having a happy hour, are you excited to bring along your significant other because you know how awesome he or she is, or do you make excuses for not bringing that person around because you hate bringing him or her out in social situations?


Sure, some people are more shy than others and some situations can be more fun without your significant other, but generally, you should be proud of the person you're with and feel excited to show him off. If you're not happy about other people seeing you with that person, then how can you be happy in the relationship?

, This kind of relationship is unhealthy. In order for the relationship to survive, the manipulative partner would need to dramatically change his or her behavior. If he or she won't, or can't, it would be wise to end it as soon as possible. If you feel like your partner is running everything you do and threatening you if you want to act independently, then you have a major problem.


If you are being manipulated or controlled, then this is one of the rare cases where you may not want to break up with the person face-to-face; if you're afraid of a violent reaction if you end the relationship, do it from a distance and have a friend help you pick up the pieces.

, If your significant other really cares about you, then he or she isn't going to demean you or be critical of you for no reason. If the person gives you constructive feedback to help you grow as a person that's one thing, but if the person is intentionally malicious, that's another. For example, if you drop and break something and your partner says something like, ""You are an idiot, why don't you look at what you are doing for once in your life?"" then that right there should be more than a sign that you need to leave that person and move on to somebody that will take better care of you.


Your partner's lack of respect may be more subtle. Maybe the person pokes fun at certain aspects of your looks, makes jabs about your career, or hints that you're not very good at something. That's still disrespect -- big time.

, It's okay to fight now and again, and fighting can even be healthy for a relationship once in a while if it helps you discuss your frustrations in a constructive manner. However, if your partner is always yelling at you, disagreeing with you, calling you names, and generally being cruel to you for no reason, then it's time to get out.

, This is a huge red flag. If your partner is embarrassed to bring you around or even to say that you two are dating, then you have a major problem. There are few good reasons for the person to hide your love, unless the person is too young to date or has a good reason to hide the relationship from overbearing parents. But if the person wants to keep it a secret from your friends or acquaintances or refuses to hold your hand or look like you're dating in public, then it may be time to end the relationship. You want to be with someone who is proud, not ashamed, to be with you, because that's what you deserve.

, If you are having a cuddling session, but you are the one that needs to start it off or try to spice things up almost every time, then you may be in trouble. Especially if you are going for the hello or goodbye kiss and you ask the person to kiss you, then there may be some real issues in the relationship. Don't be afraid to talk about it; maybe your partner has intimacy issues or doesn't want to touch you because you cheated. Whatever the problem is, you need to work on it or end things, because the status quo is not working.

, If they make you drink when you don't want to, have sex when you aren't ready, or even engage in reckless behavior like speeding, harassing strangers, or generally conducting yourself in a way that makes you scared, then it's time to end the relationship. The person does not value your wants and needs and you can find someone who actually cares for you.


It may take you a minute to realize that you have been doing something that you were not comfortable with, because you were just trying to get in the swing of things.

, Though you shouldn't end your relationship just because your best friend vaguely thinks you can ""do better,"" you should reconsider your relationship if all of your friends, family members, or even people you barely know go out of their way to tell you to get out of the relationship as soon as you can. If they have concrete reasons, like that the person really doesn't like you or treats you like a rag doll, then that's even more indicative of the fact that it's time to break up.


Of course, people may not understand how your relationship works and you can't go around basing the quality of your relationship on whether other people like the two of you together. But if everyone is telling you to get out, you should at least consider that they have a good reason for doing so.

, Your relationship should grow at its own pace and you should take the time to get to know each other. If you just met your partner two months ago and you're already talking about moving in together or getting married, then you may both be obsessed with the idea of commitment, but not each other. If you feel like you're in over your head with the relationship without ever even taking the time to get to know the person you're in the relationship with, then you need to slow down or stop.

, Okay, so if you're fifteen, it's okay to never bring up marriage, moving, where you see your careers, if you want to have kids, etc, but if you're twenty-five or thirty-five or have been dating for several years, then the subject of the future should come up eventually and naturally. If you have been together for a long time and neither of you mentions anything more than a month in the future, then chances are it's because you don't see each other being a couple in the long-term. If this is the case, then you have to think about whether the relationship is worth pursuing at all.

, Though a series of less-serious signs can also indicate the need for a break-up, there are some signs that almost always indicate that you either need to end your relationship or seriously change your tune. If these signs apply to you, then it may be time to break-up:


You've suffered physical and/or psychological abuse, financial exploitation, sexual abuse or degradation from your partner past the point of damage to your health and safety.
Your partner constantly pressures you to do something you're not comfortable with, such as being part of a dangerous or criminal activity. Harsh ultimatums and threatening statements that create pressure to are all signs of a potentially dangerous relationship. Don't fall for the ""If you really love me, you'd do this..."" trick.
Endless strife or despair has taken over the major areas of couple functioning – communication, sex, finances and emotional support.
Jealousy becomes a major issue. A relationship becomes unhealthy if your partner tries to put restrictions on who you hang out with, when, and for how long. Your partner is not in control of your social life; you are.
Your partner has been involved in long-term alcohol or drug abuse/addiction that they can't break free from and your life, or your childrens' lives, have suffered markedly because of it.
You are involved in long-term alcohol or drug addiction that you can't break free from. You aren't doing anyone any good by staying in the relationship.
Your relationship was based on superficial foundations that no longer work, such as partying, shared hobbies, or sex without love, and you are ready to move beyond these things.
Your partner tries to control what you wear and how you look. It is your body, your face, your hair, and your wardrobe; you decide what to do with it.

, A true loving partner should be loving all the time no matter what the situation is so, if your relationship is on and off, then it's time to leave because there is something wrong. Do not go back and fix the relationship because you are better without the headache as well as the heartache, and there are others that are waiting for you go find them.

, If you see yourself as a marine biologist who will travel the world and your partner wants to be a teacher and to live in Texas near her family all of her life, then you have a problem. If you don't want to have kids and she wants to have seven and to get started yesterday, then you have a problem. If your dreams and visions of the future really don't line up -- and you have to figure out your next steps soon -- then it's time to get out.


If you're still a teenager, then yeah, your life goals may change and you have time to think it over. But if you need to start planning for your futures now and there's no possible intersection, then it may be time to rethink the relationship.

, Cheating is never a good sign, whether you have a history of cheating or are cheating because you're unhappy in the relationship. Though you can learn to forgive each other, if it's a repeated thing, then chances are that too much damage has been done for your relationship to recover. This may be your way of sending each other a message that your relationship just isn't enough.

, This is a hard one. You may have really loved each other when you were in high school or college, but now you find that you're just completely different people with different friends, dreams, and interests. If you find that the only thing you have in common is your shared history, and that it isn't enough, then it may be time to move on. This is one of the hardest reasons for a break-up, because it isn't anyone's fault, and you both must still have a lot of affection for each other, but that doesn't mean you should stay together if it's not right for the people you are today.

, Any form of secrets or deception, even if you haven't gone as far as cheating, is a red flag that says that there's no trust or honor in the relationship. You shouldn't hide anything bigger than a surprise party from your significant other. This is different from not sharing your latest complaints about work with your significant other because you know it'll bore her; it's more like hiding the fact that you're interviewing for a job in a different state because you don't know what you'll do if you get it.

, If you used to go on romantic picnics, hikes, plan elaborate dates, and take care of each other when you were feeling sick, but now you can barely make the effort to pick up your phone and answer your significant other's text message, then you need to put in more effort or end the relationship. If you or your partner just aren't trying any more, then you must feel that the relationship is not worth it, deep down.

, Maybe you and your significant other have already unofficially broken up without doing the dirty work. If you spend most of your weekends with separate friends, visiting your families alone, or just staying in and pursuing your own hobbies instead of hanging out together -- think of watching two different televisions in two different rooms -- then you may be already drifting apart without having the big talk. If this is the case, then it may be time for a break up.

, If the relationship is not worth saving, you will be able to see that when both of you are calm. Additionally, breaking up out of anger can make it very difficult to find closure. Make sure you're feeling rational and have taken some time to really think about it before you have ""the talk.""

, Agree to not see each other for a week or two, and be sure to clarify that you are still together and your relationship will remain exclusive during this time. Don't spend time together, don't talk on the phone, don't send each other messages. This trial separation might help you see how much you value the relationship...or don't. If it's difficult at first, but if you find yourself at peace without this person in your life, breaking up is probably a good idea.


If you enjoy the first few days but then find yourself missing this person and feeling like your life is incomplete without them, you should probably try to repair the relationship. See more details in How to Give Each Other Space.

, If you've taken the time to think about whether or not you should end the relationship, then you can see if the signs of a good relationship apply to you, too. Here are some signs that you should fight to stay with the person you're with, even if it means that you have to take some drastic changes:


There is a core foundation of similar values and beliefs that you share, especially spiritual and moral values.
You still trust each other; you know your partner is on your side and have faith they will work with you for the greater good of your household.
Hard times have taken over suddenly without giving you time to find your center. Health problems, trauma, financial problems, addiction regressions and depression can come on in an instant and make things look really dark. Give it time, let the smoke clear, and try to be a friend to each other until it's over.
You are caught in a negative response cycle where negative behavior triggers more negative behavior. Break the cycle by gaining control of your own negative reactions, call for a peace treaty, and give your partner time to get a handle on their negativity.
You have a tendency to run from commitment at the first sign of trouble. Take some time to cool down and work to become friends again. Commit to friendship, remember what you used to like about your partner, and act like you care. It's good for you to see if you can stick through the problems for once, no matter how it ends up.
You have drifted apart slowly and suddenly discover you are living with a stranger. This generally happens due to neglect, so work on it - talk, listen, spend time together and see if you can rediscover love.

"We study the charm quark fragmentation into hadrons in perturbative QCD by using an effective coupling constant, which is determined so as to reproduce the experimental data on the total cross section for e+e-annihilation into hadrons at high energies.  We find that our results are consistent with those obtained within the framework of the conventional parton model and also with recent measurements performed by CLEO collaboration. The present analysis suggests that the charm quark fragmentation function can be well described by the Peterson form factor multiplied by a simple exponential function. 
PACS numbers: 11.10.Kk, 12.38.Qk, 13 .60.Hb 
I. INTRODUCTORY REMAR K
In this work we investigate the charm quark fragmentation functions (FFs) into light hadrons in perturbative quantum chromodynamics(pQCD). In particular, we use an effective coupling constant, αeff , which is determined so as t o reproduce the experimental data on thetotal cross section for e + e-annihilation into hadronsthat have been measured recentlybyCLEOcollaboration [1] .
The FFsof quarksintohadronicparticlesare important quantitiesin pQCDand they playanimportant role inthe calculationof various physical observables suchas the structurefunctions [2] ,the Drell-Yanprocess [3] ,and the semi-leptonic decay [4] . It hasbeen shownthat the FFsof quarksintohadronscan be calculatedperturbatively [5] - [8] . However, it shouldbe notedthatthe calculationsrequire veryhighenergy scales [9] . Therefore,it would be usefulto determineαefffromexperimentaldataat relativelylowenergies [10] ."	1
"Well, bombs are powerful compared to what? I would argue that, at the end of the day the types of bombs used by most suicide bombers (there are notable examples) are not all that big.

If you look on places like Liveleak of video of suicide bombs strapped to people there are generally only a handful of casualties inside the same room as the bomber and the building is usually left standing. Compare this to a ""bomb"" in a car that can take out the Oklahoma city building and we are talking about really small charges.

So, one of the answers is that in cases where the bomb is small enough for this to work, people survive to talk about it. When the bomb is big enough that this doesn't work, then everyone dies and you don't know anyone tried to jump on the bomber in the first place.

We will only ever hear about this working cause the other dude got blown up. Plenty of suicide bombs would kill one or several people who jumped on top of them.

There are a lot of other reasons that bodies make good shields to blast injuries; we are almost all water, which makes an incredible shock dampener and can use a huge amount of heat energy turning into steam. The fact the you are presenting such a large surface area will ""direct"" the blast the other way, deflecting some of the compression wave (one of the several mechanisms of injury from blast injury.)"	0

"Tax exempt status is allowed for nonprofit organizations that are operated exclusively for religious, educational, scientific or other charitable purpose. There are a few more rules, but those are the two big requirements: (1) nonprofit and (2) religious, education, scientific, or charitable.

As you can see, churches don't get special treatment over other nonprofits. However, you might still ask why ""religious"" organizations are included at all. One reason is that it helps maintain separation of church and state. As the Supreme Court noted in one of its earliest decisions regarding a national bank, the power to tax is the power to destroy. By not taxing churches, the state removes itself from interfering in church business and also makes sure the state doesn't start relying on church taxes for its operation.

Another reason is that historically churches were important charitable and social centers. That's still true for many churches today, but it was even more apparent when the tax laws were first being made."	0
"This is a Chinese name; the family name is Yang

Yang Chihung (; ; born 25 October 1947) is a Taiwanese-American artist.

Early life and education
Yang Chihung was born on 25 October 1947, in Chungli, Taiwan. He developed an interest in art in early childhood, and found inspirations to pursue an artist career after reading Lust for Life – The Life of Vincent van Gogh, translated by poet Yu Kuang-chung, in junior high school. Between 1965 and 1968, he attended then National Taiwan College of Art, developing a sound foundation in oil painting under the tutelage of famous Taiwanese artists of the Japanese Colonial period, such as Liao Chi-chun, Li Mei-shu and Yang San-lang. Meanwhile, he actively attended events organized by the modern art groups of Taiwan, namely the Fifth Moon Group and Ton Fan Group, only to find himself both intimidated and dissatisfied with the then relatively conservative art environment in Taiwan. In 1979, he emigrated to the United States of America with his wife, Jane, and their son, Daniel. In 1984–85 and again in 1985–86, he was twice awarded a year's residency at The Clocktower Studio in New York City by MoMA P.S.1.

Career 
In 2013, Yang, along with Xu Bing, Zhang Huan, and Li Chen, were the four artists featured in the Discovery Channel Asia documentary series, Chineseness, a multi-series production that focused on postwar Chinese contemporary artists.

"  Radial velocity surveys find Jupiter mass planets with semi-major axes a less
than 0.1 AU around ~1% of solar-type stars; counting planets with $a$ as large
as 5 AU, the fraction of stars having planets reaches ~ 10% {Marcy,Butler}. An
examination of the distribution of semi-major axes shows that there is a clear
excess of planets with orbital periods around 3 or 4 days, corresponding to
a~0.03$ AU, with a sharp cutoff at shorter periods (see Figure 1). It is
believed that Jupiter mass planets form at large distances from their parent
stars; some fraction then migrate in to produce the short period objects. We
argue that a significant fraction of the `hot Jupiters' (a<0.1 AU) may arise in
binary star systems in which the orbit of the binary is highly inclined to the
orbit of the planet. Mutual torques between the two orbits drive down the
minimum separation or periapse r_p between the planet and its host star (the
Kozai mechanism). This periapse collapse is halted when tidal friction on the
planet circularizes the orbit faster than Kozai torque can excite it. The same
friction then circularizes the planet orbit, producing hot Jupiters with the
peak of the semimajor axis distribution lying around 3 days. For the observed
distributions of binary separation, eccentricity and mass ratio, roughly 2.5%
of planets with initial semimajor axis a_p ~ 5au will migrate to within 0.1au
of their parent star. Kozai migration could account for 10% or more of the
observed hot Jupiters.

"This paper introduces a variant of the neural Turing machine (NTM, Graves et al. 2014) where key and values are stored. They try both continuous and discrete mechanisms to control the memory.

The model is quite complicated and seem to require a lot of tricks to work. Overall it seems that more than 10 different terms appear in the cost function and many different hacks are required to learn the model. It is hard to understand the justification for all of these tricks and sophisticated choices. There is no code available nor plan to release it (afaik).

The model is evaluated on a set of toy problems (the “babi task”) and achieves performance that are only slightly above those of a vanilla LSTM but are much worse than the different memory augmented models proposed in the last few years.  

In terms of writing, the description of the model is quite hard to follow, describing different blocks independently, optimization tricks and regularization. The equations are hard to read, using non standard notation (e.g., “softplus”), overloading notations (w_t, b…), or write similar equations in different ways (for example, eq (8-9) compared to (10-11). Why are two equations in scalar and the other in vectors? Why is there an arrow instead of an equal?…).

Overall it is very hard to put together all the pieces of this model(s), there is no code available and I’m afraid there is not enough details to be able to reproduce their numbers. Finally, the performance on the bAbI tasks are quite poor compared to other memory augmented models.

Because they had to adapt and change over time in order to survive, grow food etc.. because of climate changes that occurred during this period (colonial times) which caused them to move from Europe into America where there was no native population at all so it made sense to adopt new ways of living as well as adopting different accents than what they spoke before coming here. This is why you hear people talk about how Europeans who came to America brought with them their own accent but then changed after being exposed to other cultures such as Native American Indian tribes or African slaves.

"  This paper concerns the solution of the self-consistency equation for energy
gap parameter $\Delta_{\bf k}$ in the BCS theory of superconductivity. We show
that there exists a well-defined relation between the solution for energy gap
parameter amplitude $|\Delta_{\bf k}|$ for a general interaction $V_{{\bf
k},{\bf k}'}$ and energy gap $\Delta$ obtained by using the cut-off
approximation. The relation between $|\Delta_{\bf k}|$ and $\Delta$ indicates
that $\Delta$ is a weighted average over $|\Delta_{\bf k}|$ of electronic
states within cut-off energy $\xi_c$ around the Fermi surface. In this
interpretation for $\Delta$, $\xi_c$ is not a property of $V_{{\bf k},{\bf
k}'}$, but a parameter specifying the energy range within which the weighted
average over $|\Delta_{\bf k}|$ is taken. We show that the proper choice for
the value of $\xi_c$ is only a few $k_BT_c$ (i.e., $\xi_c/k_BT_c$ is about 3 or
4). We also show that the cut-off approximation, even with
$\xi_c/k_BT_c=\infty$, is a good approximation when it is used to calculate
quantities such as the condensation energy and the specific heat, but it leads
to significant overestimation for the Josephson critical current density of a
Josephson junction if $\xi_c/k_BT_c \gg 1$ is assumed.

" As soon as the noodles have come to a boil, turn off the heat and strain the noodles. Submerge shirataki in a bowl of cool water.


The shirataki shouldn’t need much cooking. Rather, the par-boiling is designed to remove some of the odor from the noodles. Then the shirataki can absorb the full flavor of the sukiyaki sauce.
If using other kinds of noodles, look at instructions and par boil until they are only a couple minutes away from being al dente.;
, Sukiyaki calls for very thin beef. Choose a marbled sirloin (or similar) cut for very good results.


Place the beef in the freezer for a couple of hours if you want to slice the beef yourself. When hard but not completely frozen through, beef is much easier to slice very thin., The stalks of the cabbage are a little more fibrous and take longer to cook. Therefore, cut right around the stalks of the cabbage until the stalks can be separated from the leaves. Cut the stalks into 1-inch (or smaller) pieces. Coarsely chop the leaves into larger pieces.

, If you weren't able to get shiitake mushrooms, cut whatever mushrooms you have into bite-size pieces. If you were able to get the shiitake, here's how to traditionally prepare them:


Remove the stem from the shiitake with a knife. Score a small star or cross into the cap of the mushroom with a knife. Imagine a straight line going through the middle of the cap. Take a knife and make a 30° angled cut along this straight line, digging only a small amount of flesh from the mushroom, enough to show the whites. Angle the knife in the opposite direction and make another 30° cut along the other side of the line. Repeat this process at the perpendicular to make a cross, and once more to make a star.
For enoki mushrooms, simply wash and cut off the root bulb to prepare.

,, If substituting spinach or watercress, rinse thoroughly and separate the leaves from the stalks. Discard the stalks.

, In a pot, bring 1/2 cup sake, 1/2 cup mirin, 1/3 cup soy sauce, and 1/4 cup sugar to a boil over medium heat. As soon as boil is reached, remove the sukiyaki sauce from the heat. The goal is to burn off the alcohol from the sake, not reduce the sauce.

, The traditional way of cooking sukiyaki involves an earthenware or cast iron hot pot with a kerosene burner underneath. This way the chef can cook at the table where he intends to serve. Alternately, an electric pan can be put to great use to cook at the table as well.


If you have neither a hot pot or an electric pan to cook with, you can of course cook the sukiyaki on the burner away from the table. Just make sure to choose a large pot with an accompanying lid.

, Beef suet is traditional, but lard or even vegetable oil can be used if the aim is a healthier meal.

, You will keep the beef in the pot while the other ingredients cook, so be careful not to overcook it. Once the beef loses its pinkness, move it over to the side of the pan so it doesn't cook at quickly.


Some cooks introduce a little bit of the sukiyaki sauce to the pan while they are cooking the beef.The sukiyaki sauce will bubble and reduce quickly because of the soy sauce.
Other cooks prefer sweetening the beef a little with plain sugar while it’s frying in the pan with the fat. There's no reason you can't do both.

, Keep all ingredients separate; each separate ingredient should be bunched together on the pan.

, Since shirataki contains a compound that makes beef tough, segregate it from the beef while all the ingredients are cooking.

, Introduce the cabbage leaves, chrysanthemum, and onions into the remaining spots of the pot.

,,, Traditionally, a dipping sauce of raw eggs is served alongside sukiyaki.The combination may not sound especially appetizing to westerners, but it is a surprisingly good combination, even if you aren’t predisposed to liking it.


If you are worried about uncooked eggs carrying salmonella or don’t like the flavor, omit them. For what it’s worth, salmonella is very rare in raw eggs., Simply grab whatever looks appetizing out of the hot pot and dip it into the egg.


If you are not eating with family or close friends, use the thicker ends of your chopsticks to grab food out communal pots. This is considered polite.

, If there are leftovers that didn’t find into the first generation of the meal, cook them now in the remaining broth. Meat and leafy greens will take less time to cook than vegetables will.

, In Japan, it is traditional to use the leftover broth as the broth for udon noodles. If you don't have enough broth but wish to make more, use the recipe for sukiyaki sauce above and combine it with the remaining sauce. Heat the broth back up to boiling, then reduce the heat to a simmer. If the broth tastes too overpowering, cut the broth with 1/3 cup of water and taste again.

"A little late to the party, but adding my two cents:

Apart from the chemical changes that happen on the soda because of it's package, an often overlooked aspect about taste is that it's a complex sense. It's not just your taste buds giving you what you ultimately experience as taste: its smell (it's not always the same as its taste), temperature and texture also add to the experience, as well as anything else going on on your mind at the time.

Get two bottles, one plastic and one glass, and put them on a freezer. Once out, they'll be roughly the same temperature, but the glass will probably feel colder.

Plastic is not that great of a termal conductor, while glass is better at it. Hence, when you place your lips on the plastic bottle, it does not feel as cold because it does not take as much heat from your lips as the glass bottle would do. And as we all know, when it comes to soda colder is always better.

Smell is also affected by the material of choice for your packaging. Plastic tends to trap more the smell (I'm guessing it's more porous so trapping the small particles is easier) while glass gives you a smoother sniff.

Every single thing going on in your mind at any given moment alters your perceptions. What you ultimately perceive and cannot describe with words (your [qualia](_URL_0_)) are a result of a very complex and unique set of phenomena. Sounds, images, sensations, smells and tastes are all altered by each other all the time.

**EDIT:** English is hard. Latin is too. Also, as some of you have pointed out, glass is a bad conductor. I just pointed out that glass is BETTER than most plastics at it. The point of this is that what you ultimately experience as taste is not just the chemical compounds of whatever it is you're tasting; it's how you PERCEIVE them, from how they interact with your tongue, nose, skin, etc. to how you process (mostly subconsciously) the whole situation."	0
"Paper summary: the authors proposed to use EdgeBoxes + Fast-RCNN with
batch normalization for pedestrian detection

Review summary: results do not cover enough datasets, the reported
results do not improve over state of the art, writing is poor, and
overall the work lacks novelty. This is a clear reject.

Pros:
* Shows that using batch normalization does improve results

Cons:
* Only results on ETH and INRIA. Should include Caltech or KITTI.
* Reported results are fair, but not improving over state of the art
* Overall idea of limited interest when considering works like S.
Zhang CVPR 2016 (Fast R-CNN for pedestrian detection) and L. Zhang
ECCV 2017 (Faster R-CNN for pedestrian detection)
* Issues with the text quality
* Limited takeaways

Quality: low
Clarity: fair, but poor English
Originality: low
Significance: low

For acceptance at future conferences, this work would need more
polish, improving over best known results on INRA, ETH, and Caltech or
KITTI. And ideally, present additional new insights.

Minor comments:
* The text lacks polish. E.g. influent -> influence, has maken ->
made, is usually very important -> is important, achieve more
excellent results -> achieve better results; etc. Please consider
asking help from a native speaker for future submissions. There are
also non-sense sentences such as “it is computational”.
* Citations should be in parentheses
* Some of the citations are incorrect because the family name is in
the wrong position, e.g. Joseph Lim, Lawrence Zitnick, and Rodrigo Benenson."	0

Diabetic persons should treat fungi under a doctor's supervision.;
,


Soak for 30 minutes each night (or up to two or three times per day -- if you are desperate). Do this for a week or two (for more economy consider saving and reusing the mixture of vinegar-salts for soaking repeatedly, if your feet are clean each time, and freshen it up with a little new vinegar and Epsom salts.)
If you'd like, you could filter it through old tee shirt material to remove settled out salts, etc.

, Begin killing it the first time, and continue about a week or several weeks, depends on depth and extent of infection.

,,


If it is too sore, wait a few sessions before removing nail debris, loosened dead skin.
If the nail is very thick, file and scrape it to be very thin, gently, without injuring yourself, to allow the vinegar mix to penetrate more effectively.

,



Air dry your feet, if you have time. The fungus really love moist skin, damp soaks/shoes and nails, allowing toenail fungus to get its ""foothold"" originally or repeatedly.

" Administering a coffee enema can have adverse health risks, including colitis,septicemia,, and rectal burns due to the temperature of the coffee. There have even been reports of coffee-enema-related deaths., Despite holistic rumors a coffee enema is unlikely to have significant effects. The caffeine absorption from a coffee enema is far less than drinking coffee, and it has a negligible effect on blood pressure and heart rate.While limited use may not be harmful to every user, the benefits appear to be minimal.

, If you are considering a coffee enema, talk to your doctor about it first. It is likely that your physician will advise against the treatment, but she may be able to offer alternatives or to give you additional information about your prognosis. Other health and lifestyle changes may have a greater effect on your wellbeing with fewer risks.

, Since the theory behind the coffee enema has to do with the body’s response to caffeine, you should try drinking coffee instead of using an enema. You will absorb more caffeine by drinking the coffee without the other health risks of the enema., If you choose do do a coffee enema despite the fact that there are few likely health benefits and many possible risks, then do what you can to minimize the risks:


Cool the temperature to an appropriate temperature to avoid burns.
Keep equipment as sterile as possible.
Watch for signs of infection and seek medical attention immediately if you experience a fever after administering a coffee enema.
Do not discontinue other types of medical treatment in favor of this unproven alternative therapy.
Do not share the enema equipment with anyone.
Always wear vinyl or latex gloves when administering enemas.

, Boil less than 1 quart because you will add ice cubes later.


Use unchlorinated water to make the coffee because chlorine could kill the bacteria and germs your system needs to remain healthy.

, (24 grams) of ground, caffeinated coffee and boil for 5 minutes.

,, This will settle the coffee grounds to the bottom of the pan and cool the liquid.

, Strain the coffee into a container you will use only for enemas, as feces could get into the syringe when you refill the bulb for your second enema.

,, The bulb will suck in the coffee and should hold about 1 cup (236 ml) of coffee.

,, If you encounter any resistance, stop. Piercing a colon is no fun if you do pierce your colon seek medical attention immediately by calling your local Emergency Medical service immediately. In the USA, that number is 911.

,, Do not strain to hold the coffee. If you feel it necessary to move your bowels before 12 minutes pass do so.

,, Rinse thoroughly with warm, clean water.

, Loosen the clamp a bit; some coffee will run out. When the air is removed from the tubing, clamp the tubing closed again.

,,, If you feel fullness or discomfort, clamp the tubing closed immediately. Remove the nozzle when you finish releasing the coffee into yourself.

,,,,,, Ensure you remove the protective cover from the nozzle before you attempt to insert the nozzle.

"We present an open-source code, called XSCORT (X-ray Spectral Code for Reprocessed Torus), which computes the reprocessing of radiation by optically-thick matter in the form of a torus and its associated wind. The code is written as a set of IDL routines that can be easily modified to study different geometries or physical conditions. We describe how we implemented our model using Monte Carlo techniques and discuss some tests performed with simulated data. Finally, we show examples of applications of this new tool to two well-studied objects, NGC 4151 and Mrk 509. 
The main goal of XSCORT is to provide a flexible framework where one can explore the effects of various parameters such as: geometry, density distribution, chemical composition, ionization state, etc., on the observed spectral properties of active galactic nuclei (AGN). This will allow us to better understand their nature and evolution. 
 
 In particular, we are interested in studying the effect of the presence of an outflowing component on the shape of the reflection hump produced by the innermost regions of the accretion disc around supermassive black holes. These winds may play an important role in shaping the broad-band continuum emission of these sources through absorption and/or scattering processes. They also affect the amount of material available to produce the reflected emission at larger distances from the central source."	1
"We study the influence of an external magnetic field Bext on the dynamics of a central spin S0 interacting with N spins S1,...,SN-1 in an antiferromagnetically ordered environment, where each spin Si interacts only with its nearest neighbors and is described by the Heisenberg model. We show that for small values of Bext (compared to J), the relaxation rate Γ(Bext) exhibits a non-monotonic behavior as function of Bext. In particular, we find that there exists a critical value Bc such that Γ(Bext) decreases monotonically if |Bext| < Bc while it increases monotonically otherwise. The dependence of Bc on the number of spins N is studied numerically using exact diagonalization techniques. 
The results are explained within a phenomenological approach based on the assumption that the effect of the external magnetic field can be modeled by introducing additional effective interactions between the spins which depend on their mutual distances."	1
Because of different hardware and software specifications between generations, backward compatible titles are usually emulated or run through an emulator program that translates instructions from one system to another. This means they will be slower than native code running natively in their original environment. The PlayStation 3 uses Cell processors while the PlayStation 4 uses AMD x86-64 CPUs with GPUs based off of Nvidia's Kepler architecture which makes it impossible to play PS3 games without slowing down considerably due to differences in processor architectures. Because of this reason Sony has decided against making any backward-compatible console systems like Xbox 360/One. They have also stated that there would never be a PS3/PS2 hybrid as well because of these reasons. Different hardware and software specifications between generationsthat make it impossible to play PS3-era games at full speed. There was no PS2/PS3 hybrid made by Sony either since both use completely different hardware	1
"It can happen with newer/poorly trained dogs and handlers. As others have said, experienced dogs and their handlers are able to read/judge each other well.

The most commonly utilized 3 breeds in the US at the moment (German Shepherd, Belgian Malinois, Dutch Shepherd) are historically used as perimeter herders for livestock. They will go after/herd something that is fleeing if they have a pretty strong instinct intact. That of course is ideal when picking out candidates for training, but can take a lot of work to focus the instinct.

A lot of dogs are also trained to be more in tune with the emotions the suspects are expressing too, so chances of a well trained dog going after an innocent are slim.
 We used to do a training exercise called ""the happy dance"" where the handler would stand calmly with the dog at plotz(laying down) and another worker would pass by and think aggressively and make gestures. The dog would get up at the alert between the person and it's handler and go nuts at the guy. Then the guy would turn around, calm down, and be happy sounding and the dog would  change it's posture and lay back down almost instantly. 

Source- worked with a K9 security company, and owned a pretty high drive flunk out Dutchie (flunked because his drive was the wrong kind for the job. Unless the perpetrators were always on bicycles... or were actual sheep.)

Edit- for all those saying ""so I should just turn around and say WHO'S A GOOD BOY"" or ""so I should just try to play with him"", I know you're trying to be funny but no. You should honestly stop and lay on the ground with your face down. The dog will still come towards you, but they are often trained to guard the suspect on the ground until the handler arrives to arrest. The handler will call the dog off.
That game we played was to test the dogs protective instinct for the handler or a threat more than anything but is an exercise for the dogs judgment no less."	0
The United Kingdom uses miles per hour instead of kilometers per hour.  The maximum speed limit outside built-up areas varies between 60 mph (97 km/h), 70mph(112km/h)  80mph  (128km/h). In built up areas such as towns and villages  50mph (80kmh).  On roads where no specific speed limits have been set 30mph (48kph).   Speeding tickets start at £60 plus court costs which could amount to several hundred pounds.   Driving under influence of alcohol carries a minimum fine of £500 and/or imprisonment for 6 months.

"CONTRIBUTIONS 
This paper introduces a method for learning semantic ""word-like"" units jointly from audio and visual data. The authors use a multimodal neural network architecture which accepts both image and audio (as spectrograms) inputs. Joint training allows one to embed both image and spoken language captions into a shared representation space. Audio-visual groundings are generated by measuring affinity between image patches and audio clips. This allows the model to relate specific visual regions to specific audio segments. Experiments cover image search (audio to image) and annotation (image to audio) tasks and acoustic word discovery.


NOVELTY+SIGNIFICANCE
As correctly mentioned in Section 1.2, the computer vision and natural language communities have studied multimodal learning for use in image captioning and retrieval. With regards to multimodal learning, this paper offers incremental advancements since it primarily uses a novel combination of input modalities (audio and images).

However, bidirectional image/audio retrieval has already been explored by the authors in prior work (Harwath et al, NIPS 2016). Apart from minor differences in data and CNN architecture, the training procedure in this submission is identical to this prior work. The novelty in this submission is therefore the procedure for using the trained model for associating image regions with audio subsequences.

The methods employed for this association are relatively straightforward combination of standard techniques with limited novelty. The trained model is used to compute alignment scores between densely sampled image regions and audio subsequences; from these alignment scores a number of heuristics are applied to associate clusters of image regions with clusters of audio subsequences.


MISSING CITATION
There is a lot of work in this area spanning computer vision, natural language, and speech recognition. One key missing reference:

Ngiam, et al. ""Multimodal deep learning."" ICML 2011


POSITIVE POINTS
- Using more data and an improved CNN architecture, this paper improves on prior work for bidirectional image/audio retrieval
- The presented method performs efficient acoustic pattern discovery
- The audio-visual grounding combined with the image and acoustic cluster analysis is successful at discovering audio-visual cluster pairs

NEGATIVE POINTS
- Limited novelty, especially compared with Harwath et al, NIPS 2016
- Although it gives good results, the clustering method has limited novelty and feels heuristic
- The proposed method includes many hyperparameters (patch size, acoustic duration, VAD threshold, IoU threshold, number of k-means clusters, etc) and there is no discussion of how these were set or the sensitivity of the method to these choices"	0
" Plan to have family worship, sing spiritual songs and have quiet time with Christ together, worshiping God and developing your walk in Christ. Be sure to study the Bible and to praise God for your opportunities and for giving you your very life. Have a personal relationship with Jesus. Anything that goes wrong pray to Him and lean not on your own understanding. Proverbs 3:5;
, is based upon loving ""Jesus"", ""Others"" and then lastly, ""Yourself""-""but not least,"" as the Bible says you are ""to love others 'as you love yourself'."" So love yourself as much as you love others and then you have the winning concept straight from Christ! This, for example, also means do not try to directly control your husband or other people (try gentle persuasion). J.O.Y. also means that you should not judge wrongly or harshly, but you will forgive yourself and others.

, The Bible says: ""Stay in a habit of attending church regularly"" with your husband or alone (or with girlfriends), if necessary. ""Pray for each other."" Pray together and ""pray without ceasing"" and ""honor Christ in all you do and say""... Our physical lives are in Christ and spiritually ""His life on this earth is in us and we are in Him."" He is ""at the right hand of the Father in Heaven where He is always interceding for us."" (Romans 8:34)

, Criticizing and putting yourself down to your husband or in front of him in public is a way of insulting his taste in women. Realize that if he is with you, it's because he chose you and wants to be with you. He finds you sexy enough, even if you don't feel like you are; so be there for him. Remember that attitude and willingness are important parts of feeling and being sexy. Poor self-esteem leaves a hole in your life that is terrible for your marriage. Make sure you continue to actually have occasional fun and help each other have an interesting life together, not just trying to control each other or only teasing about fun. Tease nicely, and mean it. Have a sense of humor.

, Will you still have girlfriends you see at least once a week, your special church group that you go to, full days and busy evenings? If you were not whole, your husband would always have to be trying to fill a hole in your life. Well, it's one that he won't ever fill, and you might both feel inadequate and unhappy, if you can't keep yourself up with friends and family as well as busy cheerfully serving Christ.

, Except in case your husband reads minds, don't expect your husband to just know what you want. If you want or need something, ask and discuss it together. Don't just drop hints and figure that he'll get it and ""come around"" without communicating calmly, clearly and directly. If something is wrong for you, say so. Christian friendships and relationships work best when each partner calmly expresses their current emotion -- without harping on what the other did. Frequently, a ""I feel confused"", or ""I feel sad"" is all it takes for him to step back and ask, ""Why?"" Then simply say, ""When you slammed the door, I felt ignored (or insulted)."" Let ""I feel..."" be your key word. Avoid saying ""you""--as in ""you made me sad."" Say ""'That' made me feel sad."" Take responsibility for your own needs and feelings.

, He needs to keep trying to do well, and you need to keep trying also, but neither of you will ever be perfect. Unsatisfied expectations frustrate everyone. However, if you both continue to work on your marriage, you will always be involved in each others lives, even when one of you comes up a little short. If your expectations are truly too high, very idealistic or unrealistic, you should set standards that are obtainable. For example, it is unfair to expect to be lavished with possessions. Have the love of your life at home; staying home, try having home cooking at several meals per week versus going out to eat junk food instead.

, Also, should you want more together time, be prepared to have that desire fulfilled with some effort, washing clothes and cleaning house together and relaxing together.

, Nagging and nitpicking can destroy a relationship. As long as the dishes get clean and are unbroken, for instance: don't nag about how you want the dishwasher loaded--the ""the right way"". Let him do such things his own way. Don't sweat the small stuff. Focus on what is more important and don't be a complainer. Maybe explain the theory as you show him how you believe it needs to be done one time and then leave it alone.""Wives, place yourselves under your husbands' authority as you have placed yourselves under the Lord's authority.""(Ephesians 5:22) but only so far as he is not doing crimes, is not cruel or actually abusive (not the blame game...) to you, the children or other persons.

, (Ephesians 5:25) If your husband is not showing love, do not demand attention or affection. Just ask cheerfully for some help and pick a time to give a playful or sexy hug and kiss: he may respond well, if he's not angry--or unless it is not the right place and time.

, This affection and fun will carry over to when you have the chance and the time in private.

, Be willing to try some innocent, new things (or even suggest/approach it affectionately without asking) and discuss them - don't just turn down fun and harmless play when he suggests something you don't feel is appealing immediately. This may make him feel rejected or that you are not having fun. At least be willing to discuss it nicely, and perhaps try it, but never do anything you are uncomfortable with after discussing it with him. Also, don't be afraid to discuss anything you might be interested in. Physical intimacy is as important to a marriage as is ""emotional intimacy"". Nurture them both.""Do not deprive each other of sexual relations, unless you both agree to refrain from sexual intimacy for a limited time so you can give yourselves more completely to prayer. Afterward, you should come together again so that Satan won't be able to tempt you because of your lack of self-control."" (1 Corinthians 7:5)

, Accept him as he is, so that you have such deep respect and gratitude for him that you would never want him to change for you. He has so much to offer you, if you give him the space to be himself. He is a growing individual, just like you are. Help him grow in the direction that he chooses, and give him the chance to help you similarly.

, ""And that women may be dressed in simple clothing, with a quiet and serious air; not with vanity about her hair and gold or jewels or expensive clothing;"" (1 Timothy 2:9) Encourage your husband to expect you to be modest in public and erotic in private with him. There is much temptation that results from women feeling as if they need to turn other men on and to show their sensual side in public. One thing may lead to another. Avoid immodesty.

, Your spouse is not perfect and he will at times upset you, or even hurt your feelings. When this happens you have a choice to make; you either harbor offense and let your heart become hardened, or you can remember how patient and forgiving God is with you and forgive your husband just as you have been forgiven by The Lord.






Quick to repent. Just as your husband is not perfect neither are you. The Bible says that ""God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble"" (James 4:6) It is so important in your relationship with your husband and with God that you be willing to humble yourself and ask for forgiveness when you are wrong, or have acted in an unloving way.






Quick to believe. 1 Corinthians 13:7 says, ""it (love) always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.""







, Don't simply focus on the bad about your husband, but see him the way God sees him; focus on the attributes that you love about him and always believe and compliment him, such as: ""Honey, God is working in your heart, and so you are becoming more like Christ everyday."" The trick is to believe this even when it doesn't look like it! That is real faith in action, believing God can bring it to reality even when you don't see it.

The future neutrino factory experiments will be able to search for new physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) with unprecedented precision, and are expected to provide important information on the origin of matter-antimatter asymmetry as well as dark matter candidates.  In this talk I will present an overview of our recent studies on how to probe various types of new physics using these facilities. The results presented here were obtained by combining the analyses performed at the T2K experiment and its off-axis near detector ND280. These include searches for sterile neutrinos, lepton flavor violating processes such as neutrinoless double beta decay, CP violation effects in leptonic sector, and exotic Higgs bosons that can couple to both quarks and leptons. We also discuss possible improvements in sensitivity which may be achieved if we combine the data taken at T2K and NOvA experiments. Finally, prospects for probing new physics at future accelerator-based neutrino factories are discussed.	1

The year starts off well enough with two wins out of three games being played before things start going downhill towards the end of the year."	1
"Frame rates are used in video cameras and computer monitors because they allow images to be displayed at higher speeds than would otherwise be possible without causing flickering.  The frame rate does not affect how our eyes perceive an object; it only affects what happens afterward when that image gets processed by other parts of the brain. No frames per second (FPS) limit exists on the human visual system's ability to process visual input from its environment. There isn't any such thing as a ""frame rate""; however, if you were watching something like a movie where each scene was shown very quickly one right after another, your mind might have trouble keeping up so you'd feel like you're seeing double. Our brains can handle all this incoming data easily enough though! no limits exist on the human visual system’s ability to process visual input... Yes, but it's still limited compared to computers.

"The authors present an interesting approach to training rectified linear networks using neural taylor approximations (NTAs). The main idea is that NTAs can be used as surrogate objective functions for optimizing parameters of rectifiers.
This work has several advantages over previous approaches such as: 1) it does not require any additional optimization steps; 2) it allows one to use gradient-based methods directly on the NTA function instead of its original form which may have non-differentiable points at zero inputs; 3) it provides theoretical guarantees about convergence under certain conditions. 
However there are some issues with this work: 
1) It seems like they do not provide enough experimental results showing how well their method works compared against other state-of-the-art techniques.  In particular I would expect them to compare performance between different types of activation functions including ReLU vs leaky-ReLU etc..."	1

"Stoicism is mainly about learning to cope. Originally it included a whole theory of the universe about fate, determinism and free will, theology... it's been called fatalistic and pessimistic. But we can adapt the main philosophy to the modern day.

Stoics believe your reaction to events in the outside world is what controls your state of mind. So it's not that you're frustrated because your boss yelled at you. You're frustrated because you think she has no right to yell at you, or because you think she was unfair, etc. The point is your own thoughts created the frustration.

Stoicism helps you to embrace the idea that things are not always going to be as you wish they were. It doesn't mean you don't care about anything. It means you develop patience to remain calm and emotionally healthy. Then, you are able to work towards making things better productively. A stoic doesn't hate, doesn't get frustrated, holds no grudges, and can never be found at the computer at 3:04AM because ""someone is **wrong** on the internet""."	0
Because they are biologically wired differently, with differing physical characteristics that affect their writing style. For example, women's hands tend to be smaller than men's so it is easier on them if letters are small; also because of differences in muscle strength between genders which affects how hard one writes.

" Toads love cool and damp places like that. Toads are like tan colored frogs, but they have bumpy skin. The large brown wart behind each eye tastes bad if bitten, so that makes animals not want to eat toads. Toads eat small insects, like mosquitoes, and come out at night. Toads will try to scare you if you pick them up, they will pee on you!

, Now look for a horizontal web with a funnel in one corner. Funnel spiders in the US are not dangerous. Funnel spiders in Australia are! This is where the female spider hides during the day. She comes out in the evening when the light is dim and eats insects that fall in the web. Male funnel web spiders do not spin webs and wander around your yard eating things like mosquitoes. Funnel spiders look somewhat fuzzy, are light tan, with darker stripes on the back.

, Look for a circular web shaped like a bulls eye. Orb weaver spiders make these webs. At sunrise the webs collect dew and are easily seen.

, Caterpillars are baby butterflies or moths. They eat plants. What color is it? Some caterpillars get quite large, up to 8–10 inches (20.3–25.4 cm) long, like tomato hornworms. If you have tomato plants in your yard, you will probably have tomato hornworm caterpillars. Hornworms have a little horn on their rear end.

, Look for a little pile of droppings in the evening. Now look to the leaf right above the droppings, under the leaf. Is he there?

, Ant lions are also called ""doodle bugs"". The ant lion waits for an ant to fall into the funnel, then he throws sand at the ant to make it fall down to the base. When the ant gets to the bottom, the ant lion drags him under the sand. Don't worry, there are plenty of ants left.

, In general, moths have feathery antennas, and butterflies have thin, smooth antennas. Butterflies love: purple coneflowers, butterfly weed, butterfly bush, and other flowers that have lots of nectar. Do not touch the butterfly, you are a giant to them and you could easily damage their wings.

, Bees also like the nectar from the same flowers as butterflies. There are many kinds of bees, including honey bees, larger bumblebees, and even larger carpenter bees. Honey bees are just a little fuzzy with a yellow/gold abdomen. Bumble bees are very fuzzy with black and yellow. Honey bees gather pollen on their legs and use it to make honey in their hive.

, You will often find them together. Do not touch the wasps, they can sting if they get scared. Wasps come in many colors too. The yellow-jackets are yellow and black. Steel blue cricket killers are an iridescent black/blue. The cuckoo wasp is a metallic green. Wasps in the US range from very tiny 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm), to 4 inch (10.2 cm) long cicada killers (they do sting), to 6 inch (15.2 cm) long megarhyssa. The megarhyssa has a 3"" body, 3"" egg tube, but no stinger.

, There are several bugs you might find here.

, You can pick one up. It might crawl on you and tickle you, or it might roll into a ball. Gently poke it to make it roll into a ball. After a minute (be real still) it will unroll and wander around in your hand. Pill bugs eat dead wood or dead leaves.

, They are safe to pick up, but are messy. They have 2-4 antennas which are their eyes. They leave a slime trail wherever they go. They need a damp place to live.

, They eat dead leaves also.

, The common centipede is a golden color, flat, and has many legs that stick way out from its side.

, They look like a tube with legs going straight up and down. They are not flat. You can catch them, but they will probably freeze. If you hold real still and do not breathe on them they might start moving again.

, There are many sizes of ants, from the tiny brown sugar ants, commonly found between your sidewalk cracks (which also appear in your kitchen looking for sugary foods), to larger carpenter ants which eat wood.

, They eat other bugs and are called ""shield bugs"".

, Japanese beetles are smaller beetles and have iridescent, metallic green and yellow colors. June beetles are a dark brown. They do not bite, and are slow moving. They can fly and they might try to fly away if you pick them up!

, You should get a heavy duty minnow net with a 5 foot (1.5 m) handle so your teacher can scrape the bottom of the pond or stream.;
, Make good contact with the bottom the whole time then quickly bring up the net so nothing swims out of it.

, Crayfish can really hurt if they pinch you, you must be specially trained to pick up an adult crayfish. If the crayfish is under an inch it should not be able to pinch you. Crayfish eat dead and dying plants and animals on the bottom of the stream. Crayfish have many names like: crawfish, clawfish, mudbug, and others.

, They eat things that are smaller than themselves. There are too many types of minnows to name. but if the adult is less then 4 inches (10.2 cm) long, it's probably a minnow. In the spring they swarm by the hundreds or thousands in the same place to lay eggs.

, They look like skinny sticks with legs. Some have a breathing tube as their tail, which they poke above the water to breathe. If you catch one in a net it is safe to pick them up GENTLY by the breathing tube. Don't get near their mouth, they will bite if scared! They eat anything that swims by.

, Toad tadpoles, or ""toadpoles"", are solid black and the smallest of the bunch. Frog tadpoles are always shades of green and tan. Bullfrog tadpoles can take up to 2 years to turn into a frog, and they are the biggest of them all! The head and tail can measure 3 inches (7.6 cm)!

, Pick it up by the sides so it doesn't bite you. It is also called a ""toe biter"" because sometimes swimmers step on them, they get scared, and bite the person on the toe. The bite is not dangerous but it sure hurts! Giant water bugs can fly. They come out at night and can be found below porch lamps there were turned on at night. They can also be found after they land in a pool, or land on a car windshield because it looks like water. In some countries, like India, the giant water bug is called a ""water scorpion"".

, Mosquito larva are worm-shaped, but have to breathe air. If they feel someone walking buy, or see a moving shadow, they will wiggle themselves in an ""S"" shape to the bottom of the pool. Wigglers can be found in almost any standing water. Adult midges look just like mosquitoes but midges do not bite. Larva get to 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) long at most. Mosquito larva that look like a comma will hatch into adults within 24 hours.

, They are called ""glass"" shrimp because they are clear. Their stomach is at the top of their back, behind their eyes, and you can see what he ate. They are also called ""ghost shrimp"".

, They are also called ""tadpole shrimp"". They have short life spans, about 6-8 weeks. They look like tiny 1–2 inch (2.5–5.1 cm) long horseshoe crabs. Their eggs survive drying, so they are sold in hobby stores. The triops got its name because it has 3 eyes, although you can see only 2. The shape of its eyes make it look mad, but it is safe to pick up. It may flop around in your hand and tickle you.

Air conditioning removes humidity from the air, making it dryer and colder than normal indoor temperatures would be in humid weather conditions. This is especially true if you are used to being outdoors where there is moisture present that evaporates into your skin as warmth when you're indoors with no evaporation of water vapor taking place on your body's surface. The same effect happens during winter months because heating systems remove moisture from the air too. Air-conditioning also makes people shiver more often by removing heat faster than they can produce it themselves (especially those who have not acclimated). Indoor temperature standards vary widely around the world; however most countries use 18 °C or 65 °F as their standard.  For example, in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece, Cyprus, Malta, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia-Montenegro, Macedonia, Montenegro, Albania, Bulgaria, Romania, Moldova, Ukraine, Belarus, Russia, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Nepal, Bhutan, Burma/Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Brunei Darussalam, Vietnam, China, Japan, Korea, Mongolia, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao, North America, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Mexico, Central America, Caribbean Islands, United States, Argentina, Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay, Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Guatemala, Belize, Bermuda, Bahamas, Barbados, Antigua & Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, Saint Kitts-Nevis-Anguilla, Saint Lucia, Montserrat, Trinidad-Tobago, Turks & Caicos islands, Jamaica, Haiti	1
"The internet would be controlled by large corporations like Verizon who can charge more money or limit access based on their own interests.  This is not in your best interest as an American consumer! The Internet would become less free than it already is now!  You wouldn't have any control over how much you pay each month because companies could decide that they want to make more money off of you so they'd raise prices without telling anyone about it!
You'd also lose out on all those great websites you've come across online such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram etc... If these sites are blocked from being viewed then you'd never know they're there unless someone told you where they are located (which might take years).  And if you're paying extra just to view them you'll probably end up spending even MORE money every year! Large corporations won't care about YOU anymore - they'll only think about making themselves richer at YOUR expense!!  They'll do whatever THEY feel is right instead of listening to US consumers which means we can't trust them with our data either!!!"	1

Mao was not in power during World War II and did not have any influence on it while Hitler had great impact by being leader of Nazi Germany at that time. He also committed suicide before he could be captured or killed which makes him less scary than Mao's death sentence if found guilty. Also because most people know little to nothing about Mao but are aware of what happened under Hitler rule. Because Mao wasn't in charge when WWII took place like Hitler. And Mao didn't commit suicide so you would probably get executed if caught doing something wrong! You wouldn't want to die like Mao right? Yes I do think it's fairer to talk about Mao too though. No one knows much about Mao except maybe some history buffs. But everyone has heard of Hitler even those with no knowledge of world events. The Holocaust is well known compared to other mass killings such as Stalinist purges where millions were murdered	1

"This work makes several important advances towards making deep neural networks more secure against adversaries who have access only to an untrusted network.  The authors show that their approach works well with large-scale data sets such as Imagenet.
The results suggest that using adversary-trained models may be useful even if they do not know exactly what kind of attacks will occur during deployment. 
I am very impressed by these findings! 
Overall I think it's great news. 

It would also be interesting to see whether similar techniques could help improve security when deploying other types of ML systems like reinforcement learners. Yes  This article should definitely get accepted. No  There might still be some minor typos/grammar issues but overall I'm happy with the quality of writing here"	1
"  Community structure is an important property of complex networks. An
automatic discovery of such structure is a fundamental task in many
disciplines, including sociology, biology, engineering, and computer science.
Recently, several community discovery algorithms have been proposed based on
the optimization of a quantity called modularity (Q). However, the problem of
modularity optimization is NP-hard, and the existing approaches often suffer
from prohibitively long running time or poor quality. Furthermore, it has been
recently pointed out that algorithms based on optimizing Q will have a
resolution limit, i.e., communities below a certain scale may not be detected.
In this research, we first propose an efficient heuristic algorithm, Qcut,
which combines spectral graph partitioning and local search to optimize Q.
Using both synthetic and real networks, we show that Qcut can find higher
modularities and is more scalable than the existing algorithms. Furthermore,
using Qcut as an essential component, we propose a recursive algorithm, HQcut,
to solve the resolution limit problem. We show that HQcut can successfully
detect communities at a much finer scale and with a higher accuracy than the
existing algorithms. Finally, we apply Qcut and HQcut to study a
protein-protein interaction network, and show that the combination of the two
algorithms can reveal interesting biological results that may be otherwise
undetectable.

"Figure skaters compete against each other by performing their own original choreography.  The judges score them based upon how they perform.   There are several different types of competitions available;  however,  figure skater's main goal should always remain the same - to skate beautifully!  Here are tips from professional figure skaters:   Warm-Ups:  You must arrive early enough to warm up properly.  This means warming up both physically...and mentally!
Competition Tips:  Don't forget about your routine when you're not actually skating;  it's important to stay focused throughout the entire competition.  If possible, try to find someone who has already performed her program during previous competitions.  Watching another person perform helps give you insight into what she did right/did wrong.  It also gives you ideas for things you might add/subtract from yours.  Keep practicing:  Practice often until you've perfected every move in your routine.

"  Extending our earlier work on PSL(2|2), we explain how to reduce the solution
of WZNW models on general type I supergroups to those defined on the bosonic
subgroup. The new analysis covers in particular the supergroups GL(M|N) along
with several close relatives such as PSL(N|N), certain Poincare supergroups and
the series OSP(2|2N). This remarkable progress relies on the use of a special
Feigin-Fuchs type representation. In preparation for the field theory analysis,
we shall exploit a minisuperspace analogue of a free fermion construction to
deduce the spectrum of the Laplacian on type I supergroups. The latter is shown
to be non-diagonalizable. After lifting these results to the full WZNW model,
we address various issues of the field theory, including its modular invariance
and the computation of correlation functions. In agreement with previous
findings, supergroup WZNW models allow to study chiral and non-chiral aspects
of logarithmic conformal field theory within a geometric framework. We shall
briefly indicate how insights from WZNW models carry over to non-geometric
examples, such as e.g. the W(p) triplet models.

"This article presents some new ideas about applying attention mechanism into various NLP problems by introducing structure information from other sources (e.g., CRF). The experiments demonstrate promising results across several datasets.
The authors should make sure their code will run smoothly when readers try it themselves before publication.  For example,  if there were any issues running the provided demo codes at https://github.com/zhaojiayu/structural-attention-nets , please fix them first so others could reproduce your findings easily. I think it's also important to provide more details regarding what exactly you did during each step of implementation process. This would help people understand better what's going on behind those experimental results. Finally, I'd like to suggest adding one section discussing possible future directions based on current research status."	1
In this work, we propose an efficient multimedia content distribution scheme for hybrid wireless networks (HWNs). The proposed scheme is based on weighted clustering and can be used to distribute the same or different types of contents simultaneously over HWNs with multiple base stations (BSs) and mobile users (MUs), where each BS has limited storage capacity. In order to maximize the total number of MUs that receive their requested contents within their deadlines, our objective is to minimize the maximum delay among all MUs by optimizing the cluster sizes at each BS. We formulate the problem as a mixed integer linear programming model and solve it through Lagrangian relaxation-based heuristics. Extensive simulation results show that compared with existing schemes, the proposed one achieves better performance in terms of average user satisfaction ratio and average transmission time per MU. Keywords: Multimedia content distribution; Hybrid wireless networks; Delay minimization	1

We report the discovery of massive outflows (1000 km s-1) in two post-starburst galaxies, which are thought to be progenitors of present-day elliptical galaxies. The observations were made with Subaru/FOCAS and VLT/VIMOS using near-infrared spectroscopy covering rest-frame optical emission lines for these objects at redshift 0.6. We found that both galaxies show strong [O III]5007Å/Hβ ratios indicating high ionization parameters. In addition, we detected blueshifted high-velocity components in Hα profiles as well as broad wings on their Hα line profiles. These results suggest that there is an energetic ionized gas flow driven by AGN and/or supernovae activity.

They don't have to worry about that because it's unlikely enough of them will place such large wagers at once, so their odds are good no matter what happens in any given game or race. They also take into account how much risk they're willing to accept when setting up each individual betting line (the amount you can win by placing your bet). If you're interested in learning more I would recommend reading this article from Investopedia which explains all of this: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/oddspread.asp#ixzz5hq7yvW9E . The people running these types of businesses aren't worried about losing profits due to one person winning big; it's very rare for someone to put down thousands of dollars worth of bets with just one bookie.  It's not like gambling where there is only 1 winner out of 100 players - there's always going to be winners and losers among those participating in an online casino's games.

"The film opens in the year 1630, when Captain Henry Every (Richard Chamberlain) sails his ship The Pelican to attack Vigo on Galicia's north-western coast and sack it.
Every is accompanied by Lieutenant John Drake (Michael York), who has been sent from England as part of a secret mission to obtain information about Spain's defences along its northern border against France."	1
"We do not think simplicity is our drawback of our method. On the contrary, we believe this is a great advantage of our method. Being technically simple does not mean no novelty, and it should never be a reason to reject a paper. In fact, Batch Normalization is a very simple method, while dropout is even simpler. These techniques have had huge impacts to the field despite the simplicity. As the Reviewer2 indicates, there are also prior simple but important methods in domain adaptation. (e.g. “Frustratingly Easy Domain Adaptation” and “Return of Frustratingly Easy Domain Adaptation”) Further, to our best knowledge, there are no prior works to exploit Batch Normalization for domain adaptation.

The main contributions in our paper is that we propose a simple yet effective AdaBN method for domain adaptation by modulating the statistics in all BN layers, which outperforms the states-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method is complementary with other existing methods. Thus, we think it is valuable for the researchers in the field.

The US government is not satisfied with how Fidel Castro has ruled his country since 1959, and wants him to step down from power in favor of democracy. The Cuban Revolution was led by Fidel Castro who took over after Batista fled into exile following a failed coup attempt on March 10, 1952.  Since then he has been dictatorially ruling the island nation as its president until 2008 when Raúl Castro became President.   He continues to hold that position today.    Because of this history between these two countries there are many issues which prevent them from normalizing their relationship including human rights violations committed by the Cuban government such as:  political prisoners, freedom of speech restrictions,  censorship,   lack of religious freedoms, persecution of homosexuals   etc., economic problems caused by decades of mismanagement under communist rule (e.g. high unemployment), corruption within the government system, poor health care services, low literacy rates among children	1
"The Young Avengers are a fictional superhero team appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The team, created by Allan Heinberg and Jim Cheung, features numerous adolescent characters who typically have connections to established members of Marvel's primary superhero team, the Avengers. The Young Avengers were originally featured in a twelve issue run, later appearing in several notable Marvel crossover series, including the Civil War and The Children's Crusade events, before the series was relaunched in January 2013 as part of the Marvel NOW! rebranding by writer Kieron Gillen and artist Jamie McKelvie.

The original series won the 2006 GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Comic Book and the 2006 Harvey Award for Best New Series. The second volume by Kieron Gillen also received the award for Outstanding Comic Book at the 25th GLAAD Media Awards in 2014.

Young Avengers follows the events of the 2004–2005 ""Avengers Disassembled"" storyline. The four founding members of the team are gathered as a result of the Vision's plan for the reformation of the Avengers in the event the team disbanded. In the series, newspapers refer to the young heroes as ""super-powered fanboys"" and label them the ""Young Avengers,"" a name the team members initially dislike but which sticks nonetheless.

Marvel's 1940s forerunner, Timely Comics, had an unrelated character, Young Avenger, who debuted in USA Comics #1 (Aug. 1941).

Fictional team biography

Volume 1
In ""Sidekicks"" (issues #1–6), reporters Jessica Jones (a former teen superhero known as Jewel) and Kat Farrell of The Daily Bugle and heroes Captain America and Iron Man investigate a new group of teenage heroes. The story is set in the time between the ""Avengers Disassembled"" storyline and the beginning of New Avengers. Although the team defeats Kang the Conqueror, Captain America and Iron Man take away their gear and refuse to train the team without their parents' consent. Despite the heroes' warnings, the team continues with a new headquarters, new costumes, and new names.

In ""Secret Identities"" (issues #7–8), the Young Avengers must decide how much to tell their parents after the members decide to continue acting publicly. None of their parents find out. During a fight with Mr. Hyde in Young Avengers #8, Wiccan discovers Eli abusing Mutant growth hormone (MGH) which gives people powers for short periods. Eli confesses that he deceived Iron Lad who meant to recruit his missing uncle Josiah in order to join the team.  He quits the team, overwhelmed with emotion.

At the insistence of Kat Farrell, Jessica Jones interviews the Young Avengers about their pasts. Cassie Lang had a troubled home life, especially after her father Ant-Man died. She and her mother constantly fought, and she hated her mother's boyfriend. Had the Young Avengers not formed, Cassie planned to join the Runaways. Teddy Altman abused his shapeshifting powers to spend time with a more popular kid. He realized that he had gone too far when his ""friend"" tried to force him to steal artifacts from the destroyed Avengers Mansion. Billy Kaplan had a problem with being accepted because of his sexuality. He was tormented and physically abused. He met the Scarlet Witch, who explained that being different is not bad. He eventually stands up to his tormentor for another kid. He nearly kills him when his powers become dominant. Kate Bishop was brutally assaulted in a park. Eli Bradley used MGH because he felt powerless against some thugs and wanted to prove that his grandfather truly was the black Captain America.

K'Lrt the Super-Skrull tries to take Teddy to the Skrull homeworld. K'Lrt reveals that Mrs. Altman is not Teddy's mother and kills her. In the aftermath, K'Lrt kidnaps Teddy. The Vision offers to locate more Young Avengers using his prior incarnation's contingency plan. The Young Avengers break Thomas Shepherd out of a superhuman prison and recruit him. Tommy can move at superhuman speed and accelerate matter, destabilizing it enough to cause an explosion. The Super-Skrull tells Teddy of his true origin as the son of the Kree hero Captain Marvel and the Skrull princess Anelle. He then claims that Tommy and Billy are the Scarlet Witch and Vision's lost twin sons. Billy believes him, but Tommy does not. Kree and Skrull combat forces arrive and fight each other and the Young Avengers until Teddy, realizing his importance to both sides, calls for a ceasefire. The Avengers intervene and a Kree warrior fires at Captain America. Patriot intervenes and is gravely wounded. Hulkling and K'Lrt end the fighting by secretly shapeshifting into each other's forms. Captain America and K'Lrt, disguised as Hulkling, broker a shared custody between the races.

At a hospital, Eli's grandfather donates his blood to Eli. Captain America again tells the Young Avengers to stop what they are doing. Kate blames their trouble on the Avengers for not training them. The Young Avengers repair the statues of fallen Avengers at Avengers Mansion. Eli now has superpowers as a result of the blood transfusion. Kate receives Hawkeye's bow and quiver from Captain America, and she takes the mantle of Hawkeye. Tommy arrives in costume and calls himself Speed.

""Civil War""

In Civil War #2, the members of Young Avengers are captured by S.H.I.E.L.D. for not complying with the registration act. Captain America and the Falcon help them escape, freeing Wiccan, allowing him to teleport the group to a base only known to Nick Fury and a few resistance fighters. Once in Captain America's secret base, the Young Avengers join the resistance movement called Secret Avengers. The Young Avengers joins the fight against Iron Man and the pro-registration heroes. Stature leaves the resistance after Goliath is killed by a clone of Thor and the Secret Avengers are forced to retreat from battle leaving Wiccan behind. However, shortly afterwards Stature registers and begins superhero training. The remainder of the team remained with Captain America. Stature is seen alongside Iron Man and the rest of the ""pro-reg"" group during the final battle between registered and rebel heroes. Deadpool is commissioned as a ""hero hunter"" in the war and frequently remarks how he'd like to capture ""those nubile Young Avengers"".

With the surrender of Captain America, the rest of the Young Avengers are granted amnesty in exchange for registration. All the members except Hawkeye, Patriot and Speed registered, and began training at Camp Hammond. In the last issue of the Fallen Son crossover, when the funeral of Captain America takes place at Washington D.C., all of the Young Avengers are seen, wearing their Super Hero outfits, and are even mentioned by name by the Falcon, while delivering the ceremonial speech. This suggests another amnesty was offered to Hawkeye, Patriot and Speed, who had stayed in the resistance after the end of the Civil War, alongside the New Avengers.

In She-Hulk #21, it was revealed that the Hulking and Wiccan that joined the Initiative were actually a pair of interdimensional travelers known as ""Alphas"" whereas the actual Hulkling and Wiccan were shocked at the discovery that they had registered. Hawkeye, Patriot, and Speed, remain unregistered.

""Young Avengers Presents""
In the 2008 miniseries Young Avengers Presents, Patriot discovers that Bucky had visited his grandfather Isaiah Bradley. After tracking him down, Patriot shares his concerns losing faith in the country. Bucky explains to Eli that America is an idea used for good or ill, but one with value to it and something worth defending against all threat, inspiring the younger hero once more. Hulkling meets Mar-Vell, telling him that he is his son, much to Mar-Vell's shock. While Captain Mar-Vell is proud of his son, he confesses that he will not be able to stay forever, as the survival of the time stream depends on him eventually returning to the past and dying from cancer. This Captain Marvel eventually turned out to be a Skrull sleeper agent in place for the ""Secret Invasion"". Wiccan and Speed begin searching for the Scarlet Witch, whom they believe to be their mother. Upon searching the former home of the Scarlet Witch and Vision in Leonia, NJ; they encounter Master Pandemonium, who advises them to end their search and embrace their present lives. Vision tells Cassie that after ""Civil War"", he traveled around the world posing as different people, living many different lives, ultimately culminating in a better understanding of who he is. He asserts that he is his own person, not the memories of Iron Lad, confessing his love to Cassie, and states that he wishes to now be called Jonas. Cassie demonstrates that she is unsure but is willing to reciprocate his feelings. During the story, Cassie is also stricken with guilt after accidentally injuring her stepfather while stopping a villain, forcing her to come to terms with the responsibilities that come with her powers and with being part of the Young Avengers and the Initiative, much as her stepfather also understands the risks of life as a policeman. Hawkeye feels uncomfortable about her growing relationship with Patriot, and encounters Clint Barton, the original Hawkeye, who helps her reaffirm her position as Hawkeye and Young Avengers co-leader.

""Secret Invasion""
In the 2008 miniseries Secret Invasion: Runaways/Young Avengers, the Young Avengers again teamed with the Runaways in a Secret Invasion tie-in. The Young Avengers are the first to respond to the Skrull invasion in Manhattan, New York. They are quickly defeated, though Xavin manages to rescue Hulkling. The leaders of the Skrull invasion intend to assassinate Hulking, for fear that his identity as Dorrek VIII would diminish their authority. During the confrontation between the Young Avengers, Runaways, and the invading Skrulls, Xavin is forced to confront her former mentor, Commander Chrell, reluctantly killing him to save the Young Avengers and Runaways.

""Dark Reign""
The 2009 Dark Reign: Young Avengers limited series written by Paul Cornell, and Mark Brooks, introduced a new group consist of Enchantress, Executioner, Coat of Arms, Egghead, Big Zero and team leader Melter, who are powered teens calling themselves the Young Avengers. After Secret Invasion, all the Young Avengers remained under low profile during Norman Osborn's Dark Reign, who sent this version of Young Avengers and send them to battle only to fall against the original Young Avengers. They join forces with the genuine Young Avengers to battle Norman Osborn's Dark Avengers.

""Siege""
In the ""Siege"" storyline, following the attack of Asgard, Steve Rogers calls on the Young Avengers to aid in the help of Asgard against Norman Osborn's Dark Avengers and Initiative. Stature and Vision aid Amadeus Cho and U.S. Agent in stopping the Thunderbolts from stealing Odin's spear for Norman Osborn. With Patriot and Hawkeye entombed under the ruins of Asgard, Speed anxiously ferries a number of wounded Asgardians to safety, looking for his teammates. Wiccan and Hulkling take on and defeat the Wrecking Crew, who were looting the ruins of the Throne Room. Wiccan strikes the villains down with lightning bolts, much to Hulkling's wonder and worry.

Avengers: The Children's Crusade

The Young Avengers appear in the 2010–2012 miniseries, Avengers: The Children's Crusade, written by Allan Heinberg and illustrated by Jim Cheung. In the series, Magneto learned that the Young Avengers were going to search for the still missing Scarlet Witch, and that Wiccan and Speed may be the reincarnations of Wanda's children. Magneto meets them, stating that he wants Wiccan and Speed to finally know him as their grandfather, and helps them find Wanda.

The Avengers attempt to stop Magneto and fight him unsuccessfully, before Wiccan teleports Magneto and the Young Avengers to Wundagore Mountain. There they encounter Quicksilver, who attempts to kill his father. However, they discover that this Scarlet Witch is actually a Doombot in disguise, prompting the Young Avengers and Magneto to journey to Latveria, with the Avengers, Quicksilver and Wonder Man following behind them.

Wiccan eventually finds the real Wanda, apparently devoid of her powers, amnesiac and engaged to be married to Doctor Doom. Wolverine tries to kill Wanda, but is prevented from doing so by the reappearance of Iron Lad. Doom also states that Wanda is depowered. Iron Lad and the Young Avengers escape with Wanda into the timestream and land in the past when the resurrected Jack of Hearts destroys the Avengers Mansion. The team escapes the explosion and involuntarily returns to the present due to Wanda, who has remembered everything. As an unexpected side effect, the life of Scott Lang is also saved.

When the group returns to the present, Scarlet Witch is shown in a depression where she thinks that she killed her father, her brother, and the Avengers. She vows to kill herself with Kree ships and Ultron clones which Hawkeye and the Young Avengers destroy. During that time, Beast and Jessica Jones arrive, where Beast learns that the Scarlet Witch that he encountered was actually a Doombot. Wiccan tells her that her father, her brother, and ""her sons"" are still alive. Billy finally gets the happy Mother-and-Child Reunion that he had been dreaming of. Beast asks Wanda if she can reverse the ""No more mutants"" spell. She is unsure a reverse spell would work. They meet up with X-Factor Investigations, which has many clients who are depowered mutants. Rictor volunteers and has his powers restored. The X-Men show up and Wanda tells X-Factor Investigations that if the X-Men want more mutants then that's exactly what she will give them.

However, a battle ensues between the X-Men and the Avengers over what to do with Wanda, forcing her and the Young Avengers to flee back to Doctor Doom. It is revealed that Wanda's enhanced powers were a result of her and Doom's combined attempt to channel the Life Force in order to resurrect her children, but it proved to be too much for Wanda to contain and overtook her. With Wiccan and Doom's help, they seek to use the entity possessing Wanda to restore mutantkind's powers but they are stopped by Patriot (who is concerned at the fall-out that would ensue if the powerless mutants are suddenly repowered), only to find out that the entity was transferred to Doom's body, giving him Wanda's god-like powers. His scars finally healed, he calls himself ""Victor"", discards his now useless mask, and promises to take care of everything. Doom becomes omnipotent with powers surpassing those of beings as Beyonder or the Cosmic Cube; he offers to use these powers to fix the Avengers' and X-Men's problems and bring their deceased friends back to life, but both teams refuse the offer. The Young Avengers confront him, aided by the Avengers, the X-Men and X-Factor; Wanda and Wiccan manage to remove Doom's newfound powers, and he reveals that he was responsible for the Scarlet Witch's doings during the ""Avengers Disassembled"" and ""House of M"" events. During the confrontation Stature attacks Doom, who responde by blasting her with a wave of energy. After Wanda and Wiccan successfully remove the powers from Doom he escapes. The last panel of issue 8 ends with the heroes surrounding Stature's stricken form.

Following the battle with Doom, Stature is revealed to have died from her injuries. Iron Lad offers to save Stature by taking her into the timestream. Vision objects to this, making Iron Lad enraged with him. Iron Lad attacks him, resulting in Vision's destruction. Iron Lad then prepared to jump into the timestream to go back and save Stature, with Wiccan warning him that this is the moment he becomes Kang the Conqueror, but Iron Lad is not deterred. With the battles over, all that was left was to determine the fate of the Scarlet Witch. Cyclops agrees to leave the Scarlet Witch alone, but states that he will kill Wanda if she turns against the heroes again. Rejecting the offer to rejoin the Avengers or her family, Wanda departs stating that after years of defining herself as Magneto's daughter, Pietro's sister, or the Vision's wife, she wants to find out who she is on her own before she decides what to do with her life. Later the Young Avengers decide to disband, much to the disapproval of Speed.  Months pass by with the events of Spider-Island, Schism, and the Human Torch's revival having occurred and the Young Avengers taking no action. All this time Wiccan was in a depressive state. Hulkling tries to get him to talk to someone, but Wiccan refuses. Wiccan then believes Hulkling is breaking up with him, leading Hulkling to make an impromptu ""proposal"". They kiss, but are interrupted by Ms. Marvel and told to get into uniform and go to the mansion.  The issue ends with the Young Avengers officially being recognized as full-fledged Avengers.

Volume 2
A new Young Avengers series, written by Kieron Gillen and drawn by Jamie McKelvie, was launched in January 2013 as part of the Marvel NOW! rebranding campaign. The new monthly series reintroduces existing Young Avengers, Wiccan, Hulkling and Hawkeye, as well as introducing Kid Loki, Noh-Varr and America Chavez to the book's cast. The series' sixth issue included the reintroduction of former Young Avenger, Speed, and the addition of depowered mutant Prodigy to the group. Over the course of the series, Wiccan and Hulkling reaffirm their commitment to one another after Hulkling faces an existential crisis; Wiccan discovers that he will one day become the all-powerful Demiurge; Prodigy comes out as bisexual, and develops a crush on Hulkling; Kate and Noh-Varr become a couple, and then later break up after Noh-Varr realises he doesn't feel as strongly for Kate as he does for his ex, Oubliette; and America Chavez is revealed to be from a paradise dimension created by the Demiurge (Wiccan). In the latter half of the series, Kid Loki believes he is engaged in a battle of wits with against his ex, Leah. However, he later uncovers that this 'Leah' is in fact a projection of his own guilty conscience, which wants to restore Loki to his true self. After tricking Wiccan into transforming him to a more mature form—that of a late teenager or young adult—he departs the group, choosing to do so before they can forgive him for manipulating and betraying them. Throughout the story, the group are also haunted by a powerful character dressed as Patriot, who captures Tommy. In the concluding issue of the series, Prodigy rightly surmises that this Patriot is a member of the team who has been transformed into a non-human in some future magical event, and is now echoing backwards along the timeline in order to ensure this future comes to pass. Guessing this person may well be himself, he kisses the Patriot, causing the Patriot to vanish and  Tommy to reappear. Volume 2 came to an end with issue #15, as Gillen and McKelvie wrapped up their story and wanted to pursue other collaborations.

Thus the team again disbanded, after Hawkeye, America Chavez, and Noh-Varr joined West Coast Avengers, Wiccan and Speed focusing their relationships with Hulkling and Prodigy respectively.

 The series also won the 2006 Harvey Award for Best New Series.

Collected editions
The stories have been collected into a number of volumes:

Controversy
In 2019, Rio de Janeiro mayor Marcelo Crivella ordered Avengers: Children's Crusade to be censored as various instances of homosexuality such as the relationship between Hulkling and Wiccan were displayed. Crivella said the content was ""improper for children"". Writer Kieron Gillen was disappointed about the changes.
The organizers of the Bienal do Livro book fair, where the comic was being sold, repudiated the mayor's decision and decided not to remove the book from sales. On September 6, Avengers: Children's Crusade sold out at the event.

Other versions

What If?
In 2008, a story titled ""What If the Runaways Became the Young Avengers?"" ran as a back-up story through five What If? issues. The feature illustrates what would have happened if Iron Lad never found out about the Avengers Fail-Safe Program. Instead, he recruits the Runaways, forcing them to be an actual superhero team with costumes. Although it is later revealed that the Iron Lad that brought them together was actually Victor Mancha—Iron Lad ran into Victor's future self when attempting to flee to the Avengers' era, with Victorious travelling back with him and using Victor to hi-jack his equipment—Kang's attempt to rescue his younger self results in Iron Lad being killed and Kang being erased from history while Victor destroys his future self and departs via Kang's time-belt to find his own way, leaving the Runaways to continue as Young Avengers with Chase now using parts of the Iron Lad armor. It was written by C.B. Cebulski, and drawn by Patrick ""Spaz"" Spaziante.

In other media

Video games
 The Young Avengers appear as unlockable playable characters in Lego Marvel's Avengers. The members featured are Wiccan, Speed, Kate Bishop, Hulkling and America Chavez.

Marvel Cinematic Universe
Following the Marvel Cinematic Universe introduction of Young Avengers from the comics in Phase Four such as Billy and Tommy Maximoff, Eli Bradley, Cassie Lang, America Chavez, Kate Bishop, and Kid Loki, media outlets speculated that Marvel Studios was building towards a team-up film or series based on the Young Avengers. Speaking about the possibility of this, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige said with the new characters being introduced in Phase Four, ""the potential [was] endless"". Elizabeth Olsen, who portrays Wanda Maximoff in the franchise, said that she had ""no idea"" of any plans for such a project, although she believed that it ""could be a possibility"".

"This paper tries to leverage an external lexicon / knowledge base to improve corpus-based word representations by determining (in a fuzzy way) which potential paraphrase is the most appropriate in a particular context.

I think this paper is a bit lost in translation. The grammatical and storytelling styles made it really difficult for me to concentrate, and even unintelligible at times. One of the most important criteria in a conference paper is to communicate one's ideas clearly; unfortunately, I do not feel that this paper meets that standard.

In addition, the evaluation is rather lacking. There are many ways to evaluate word representations, and Google's analogy dataset has many issues (see, for example, Linzen's paper from RepEval 2016, as well as Drozd et al., COLING 2016).

Finally, this work does not provide any qualitative result or motivation. Why does this method work better? Where does it fail? What have we learned about word representations / lexicons / corpus-based methods in general?"	0
"As for the answer to the question - yes. 

I am going to use this question as an opportunity to clear up some misconceptions that people have. Almost no layman correctly understands electricity. People usually think, that electricity is some magic substance, say electrons, that is ""produced"" in the power plants, transported through the wires into your house where your appliances ""consume"" it. Similar to gas or water. **But that's exactly how it doesn't work.**

The best analogy for understanding the AC system, is to imagine that instead of an electrical socket, a rotating axle is sticking out of your wall. Actually, in the early days of industrialization, that's how factories worked. They had a huge steam engine in the basement which was connected to the belt, gear and axle system. This system distributed the rotating movement around the building and all the machines on the factory floor were hooked to this single steam engine. 

So in a totally same way, your little axle in the electric socket is connected all the way to the power station that has a huge rotating engine inside. Whenever you want to power some appliance, you just hook it up to the axle and draw the rotating motion out of it. 

So the electrons are not the electric energy itself, they are the ""axles and belts"", that just carry the force (the rotating motion) produced at the power plant, right to your home.

This analogy is very precise. It explains all the things about the AC system like:

**Why does the production of an electric power always have to equal the consumption?**

What happens when you reach the top of the hill in a car, and keep up the constant press on the accelerator pedal? You will start speeding up! Your engine suddenly produces more power than the car needed when going uphill, so it has to go somewhere. On the contrary, If you reach another, steeper hill, and don't press the pedal enough, you will eventually lose your speed and stop. 

Literally the same thing happens to the AC electrical system. All the power plants rotate at the same rate of 50-60 revolutions per second (depending on your country). If not enough consuming devices ""brake"" the common axle, it will really start to rotate faster and faster. If there is too much load, it will eventually bring all the system to a grinding halt. 

**What happens when I cut the wires that go from a power plant?**

The plant engine will suddenly lose all the load and will start spooling up like crazy, just like your car when you lift the wheels up from the ground. The operators will have to enact some emergency procedure of reducing the power quickly, like for example, release the steam that drives the turbine.

On the other side of the system, all the rotating engines in all the other power plants will start slowing down, because the load is higher than they can produce. If the network operator does not have a backup engines that are ready fill the missing power quickly, the easiest solution that saves the whole network, is just to sacrifice some part of it and ""cut off"" some of the load.

**What power plant am I drawing power from?**

In a sense, from all of them. All of them are hooked to the same ""axle"" and all consumers are drawing the rotating motion from it. You cannot point to a single power plant that powers you right now."	0
"The authors explore sparsity of recurrent neural networks (RNN) for sequence prediction problems.
They propose to use an LSTM network with dropout regularization on its hidden units as well as input gates that are trained using stochastic gradient descent. 
Their experiments show improved performance over standard RNN models when applied to language modeling tasks such as predicting next word from previous context.  The results also suggest that their approach is robust against noise introduced into training data. 

Strengths: 
This work provides insights about how to improve existing RNN architectures through sparse connections between neurons within each layer.  

Weaknesses: 

It would be interesting if they could provide more details regarding why this method works better than other methods proposed earlier.    It may help readers understand whether there exists any theoretical guarantees behind these improvements"	1
"The authors present an online learning algorithm to train sum-product networks (SPNs) that have gaussian leaves, which are SPN nodes whose output is modeled by a multivariate normal distribution.  The proposed method uses stochastic gradient descent and backpropagation through time in order to learn parameters of both leaf distributions as well as weights between internal layers.
This work extends previous results on offline training algorithms from the same group.   In particular it shows how one can use batch normalization techniques during online training without having to resort to approximations or heuristics such as those used previously.    This makes this approach more robust than other methods based on similar ideas but using different approaches. 
I think it's interesting enough to be published after minor revisions. 

Author's response: Yes  - we will make some changes"	1
"The authors present an interesting approach to language comprehension using memory augmented neural networks (MANNs). The main idea is that MANN can be used as a general purpose reasoning engine, which allows it to perform tasks such as question answering and text generation.
I think this work has several important contributions in terms of both theory and practice.  First, I find their theoretical contribution very appealing because they provide new insights into how we should reason about natural languages by showing how different types of knowledge are represented within MANNs. Second, from practical perspective, I believe there will also be many applications based on these ideas since MANNs have been shown effective at performing various NLP related tasks including reading comprehension, dialogue systems etc.. Overall, I am impressed by what the authors achieved here!"	1
"Richard David Todd (born September 16, 1943) is the former mayor of San Diego and current member of Congress representing California's 13th congressional district since January 3, 2007.  He was first elected to represent this district in 2002 after defeating Democratic incumbent Jim McDermott by more than 20 points.
Todd has been married twice; his second wife died from cancer on December 31, 2006.   His son Richard Todd Jr., who served as deputy chief of staff under President George W.

Todd graduated from Harvard University where he earned both Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science and Master of Business Administration degrees before attending Santa Clara Law School earning Juris Doctorate Degree. 
He worked briefly as a lawyer specializing in real estate law but later became involved in politics when he ran unsuccessfully against Republican Rudy Giuliani for New York City comptroller in 1989.   In 1990, he moved back home to San Diego to work for then-Mayor Moscone.   After Moscone resigned due to illness following the 1994 Northridge earthquake, Todd succeeded him becoming San Diego's 45th mayor.   During his tenure as mayor, he oversaw the development of Mission Valley into one of America's largest urban redevelopment projects while simultaneously working to expand the city's international airport which had become overcrowded during the 1990s boom years.

"We present the first systematic survey of X-ray flares observed in gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows with the Swift satellite, which has been operating since 2004. We find that most GRBs show at least one X-ray flare during their prompt or early afterglow phase; we also find that some GRBs have multiple flaring episodes. The majority of these flares are soft, but there is evidence for both hard and very-hard flares as well. In addition to studying individual flares, we examine the spectral properties of all flares combined using time-resolved spectroscopy techniques. Our results indicate that the average spectrum can be described by an absorbed power law model with photon index Γ = 1.6 ± 0.1 and hydrogen column density NH = 2 × 10^22 cm^{-2}. 
 
 Using this best-fit model, we calculate the total energy emitted in each flare over its duration. For the entire sample of flares studied here, we find that the mean fluence of the flares is ~10^-7 ergs/cm^2, while the mean peak luminosity is ~10^45 ergs/s. These values correspond to typical energies released in solar flares."	1

The paper presents an interesting modification to PoWER algorithm that is well motivated. The main limitation of this paper is the lack of comparison with other methods and on richer problems. The experiments haven't given confidence to show its claimed benefits, generality and scalability over prior methods. Giving this confidence doesn’t necessarily require running your method on all large-scale domains or doing exhaustic hyper-parameter search, but for example it could go beyond current domains. Cartpole only optimizes 5 parameters. Ad targeting task lacks comparison with alternative methods. Since this method is built on PoWER and closely connected with RWR, it is likely there are limits to performance which may become apparent when the method is tried on other domains and with other benchmark methods, e.g. even standard ones like importance sampling-based off-policy learning is known to suffer in high-dimensional or continuous action space; limits of RWR/PoWER-like methods based on their connection with entropy-regularized RL. 	0
"***Edit: Here's a [crude drawing](_URL_0_) to help visualize it.*

Bob and Joe are friends. Joe lives just around the corner from Bob, so Bob decides to walk to Joe's house. He walks down his street, turns right at the corner, and walks down Joe's street. He then walks down the path from the sidewalk to to Joe's front door.

Suzy and Jill are friends. Suzy lives around the corner from Bob in the opposite direction of Joe (left at the corner instead of right). Jill lives next door to Joe. Suzy decides to walk to Jill's house, so she walks down her street, passes Bob's street, and continues onto Jill's street until she turns to walk from the sidewalk down the path to Jill's front door.

Even though Bob and Suzy can each get to their friends' houses, their friends share a street, so they both have to walk down the same section of road to get to their friends' houses. There isn't a single road that goes straight from Bob to Joe, and there isn't a single road that goes straight from Suzy to Jill. They have to share *part* of the path.

One day there is road construction, and Joe/Jill's section of the street is blocked off at the corner (shown in orange in the picture). Now neither Bob nor Suzy can reach their friend. Bob and Suzy could theoretically walk to each other's houses, because the intersection itself isn't totally blocked. Only the section that goes to Jill and Joe.

Now imagine that the road is a wire that you send a message through. In order to actually make a connection directly to someone else's computer, there would have to be a single wire going directly from your computer to their computer. Really there are hubs where a bunch of wires connect, like the intersection of Bob and Suzy's streets. That hub is then connected to other hubs where the wires split off again to go to the individual houses, like how Bob went down the path to Joe's door, and Suzy went down the path to Jill's door.

To shut down the connection to a large area like Syria, one would shut down the hubs that allow connections within that area."	0
"This work presents a novel approach towards unsupervised imitation learning with applications to autonomous robots operating in unstructured environments.  It addresses some important challenges such as how to define rewards based solely on observations rather than expert annotations.   I think this research will have significant impact if successful because it could lead to more robust systems capable of generalizing beyond what was observed during training.  

The authors should consider addressing several questions raised below before publication. 

1)  How do you handle situations where there may exist different ways to achieve each step? For example, one way might involve pushing while another involves pulling?  What happens if your system observes something unexpected like someone walking into frame instead of standing still?   2)  Are all possible outcomes considered equally likely at every state?"	1

"  We revisit the issue of the stability in the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati model,
by considering the nucleation of bubbles of the conventional branch within the
self-accelerating branch. We construct an instanton describing this process in
the thin wall approximation. On one side of the bubble wall, the bulk consists
of the exterior of the brane while on the other side it is the interior. The
solution requires the presence of a 2-brane (the bubble wall) which induces the
transition. However, we show that this instanton cannot be realized as the thin
wall limit of any smooth solution. Once the bubble thickness is resolved, the
equations of motion do not allow O(4) symmetric solutions joining the two
branches. We conclude that the thin wall instanton is unphysical, and that one
cannot have processes connecting the two branches, unless negative tension
bubble walls are introduced. This also suggests that the self-accelerating
branch does not decay into the conventional branch nucleating bubbles. We
comment on other kinds of bubbles that could interpolate between the two
branches.

Golf is played by 2-4 people using 52 standard playing cards.  It was invented during World War II when soldiers were bored waiting for mail from home.   There are several variations that allow more than three players but these will be covered later.    This version uses only 52 cards so it works best if there aren't too many players involved.     If you're teaching children how to play golf then it's better not...   For this variation you'll need an extra joker which should go into the center of the board before shuffling begins....     In this variation all players begin with eight cards instead of seven,...    To win golf quickly try replacing high-scoring cards such as aces and eights with low-scoring ones such as twos and fours.  It's also important to remember what other players have because they may take away some of those higher scores you've been hoping for.  Remember that you don't always get exactly what you ask for; sometimes you just get something else!    A good strategy would be:  Keep track of who plays last every round.  Don't let yourself become complacent about winning!  Be aware of the fact that you might lose even though you think you won.  Know where to look while counting your points:	1

"The authors present an interesting approach to unsupervised learning that is based on finding generalizable features in data sets.  The main idea of their method is to find clusters within each class (clustering) which are similar across classes.
Strengths:  This work has several advantages over other clustering methods such as k-means.   First it does not require any prior knowledge about number of clusters for different datasets; secondly,  unlike most existing algorithms this algorithm can be applied directly without requiring preprocessing steps like feature selection etc., thirdly its computational complexity scales linearly with respect to dataset size rather than quadratic scaling associated with many other clustering techniques.    Finally they show how these clusterings can be used effectively to perform classification tasks using only unlabeled examples from target domain. 
Weaknesses: 
There seems no obvious way to extend this technique beyond binary problems i.e. when there are two possible outcomes per example e.g. positive/negative sentiment prediction task.  
Also I am curious if one could use some kind of regularization term here so that we don't get too much overlap between clusters?"	1

"Because of inertia and friction between moving parts within motors that are spinning at high speeds. The faster something moves forward, the more momentum there will be behind them.  This means if you stop pushing your car's accelerator down suddenly (or even just ease off), then all those gears inside the engine won't immediately slow down either.   They'll keep going until their momentum has been exhausted by friction with other components like bearings and pistons.    Because of this phenomenon called ""backlash"",  you'll feel as though you're being pushed backward while driving forwards because the gearbox isn't able to change directions instantly enough.     Backlash can also occur during braking -  but it's less noticeable than when starting from rest since there's already some resistance against motion before applying pressure to brake pedals. Friction causes energy loss which results in heat generation. Inertia refers to an object's tendency to continue its current state unless acted upon by another force"	1

How does it perform on small datasets? 2) What do you mean by ""nonparametric"" learning here ? 3) In Figure 1 , what is the meaning of ""Non-Parametric""? 4) Why did they use two different methods to train their networks with same dataset? 5) Is this approach scalable?  6) Can I get more information about how many layers were used in each network? 7) Are these results statistically significant?

"Bookies do two things when arranging bets to make money. First, they try to make even odds so that there are equal numbers of people on both sides of the bet. Second, they make it so the odds don't quite even out and there will be money leftover for the bookie.

For example, say a bookie is taking bets on a football game between the Texans and Cowboys. If too many people are betting for the Cowboys, the bookie will adjust the point spread to encourage more people to vote for the Texans. They keep doing this until people are betting on both sides evenly. They also make it so that you have to bet something like $110 to win $100. Now let's say 10 people bet on the Cowboys and 10 on the Texans and they all bet $110. That's $2,200 total. The Texans win with the point spread. The bookie pays each person who bet on the Texans $210 - the original $110 back plus the $100 they won. That's $2,100 he has to pay out total. The bookie gets to keep the leftover $100. Put another way, each Cowboys bettor put up $110. $100 of that goes to each person who bet on the Texans for winning and $10 is leftover of the bookie.

Since there are an equal number of bets on both sides, the math works out the same no matter who wins."	0
"We study the phase diagram of a model system consisting of particles interacting via an attractive Yukawa potential, which is balanced by a short-range repulsive term. We show that this simple model can reproduce many features observed in experiments on colloidal suspensions near their glass transition temperature Tg. In particular we find that for temperatures below some critical value Tc there exists a metastable liquid state characterized by strong density fluctuations. The relaxation time of these fluctuations diverges at Tc as predicted by mode-coupling theory (MCT). Above Tc the equilibrium state consists of a disordered gas-like phase. For large values of the coupling constant between the two potentials the gas-liquid coexistence line ends in a first-order phase transition to a solid state. This transition occurs close to the MCT prediction for the ideal glass transition point. Our results are obtained using molecular dynamics simulations combined with free-energy calculations based on thermodynamic integration techniques. 
 
 1 Introduction 
 
 Glass-forming liquids exhibit fascinating properties such as non-exponential relaxation [1–3] or dynamic heterogeneity [4–6]. These phenomena have been studied extensively over several decades [7–9] but still remain poorly understood. One reason for this lack of understanding lies in the fact that glassy systems are out of thermal equilibrium [10] so that standard statistical mechanics methods cannot be applied directly. However, it has recently become possible to investigate glassy states experimentally [11–13] and numerically [14–18]. A particularly interesting class of glass-formers comprises colloidal suspensions [19–21] whose slow dynamics can be probed by light scattering [22]. It was found that the relaxation times diverge when approaching the so-called glass transition temperature T g . Close to T g , the relaxation process becomes extremely slow and the system falls out of equilibrium within experimental observation times [23]. Therefore, one usually studies the dynamics of colloids well above T g where they behave like normal fluids [24]. Nevertheless, even in this regime the relaxation processes are not completely understood [25]."	1
The East German Championship was the highest level of competition in women’s professional basketball played within the Socialist States of Germany (SED) from 1974 to 1990, and included teams representing all three states that comprised it at various times during its existence – East Berlin, East Prussia/GDR proper and Thuringia/East Hesse.  The tournament began as part of the Eastern Bloc Games held annually between countries such as Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, USSR/Russian SFSR and Yugoslavia.   In addition to these games there were also annual competitions involving only GDR teams which took place on home soil or abroad.    From 1977 until 1989 this event was known by another name - the National Cup.   This is because the Soviet Union had already established their own national cup competition called the All-Soviet Union Basketball Championships since 1956.   Since then many former players have been able to recall how they felt about playing against foreign opponents who came over specifically to take part in the Eastern Bloc Games.   They described them as being very strong physically but lacking any real skill set when compared to the local talent available in the GDR itself.   It should be noted however that some of those same players would later go onto represent their country internationally after reunification.   For example Uwe Barschall represented West Germany at both Olympic Games and European Championships while her sister Anke won two gold medals at the 1988 Summer Olympics alongside teammate Sonja Henie.

"I'm a lawyer and I advise my clients to write these things into their job applications.  Here's whats what: companies don't want equality assurance, they to avoid a PR nightmare.

There have been instances when well-intentioned companies opted for gender-blind, race-blind hiring and end up hiring 40 privileged white males.  It's a publicity nightmare because someone like Al Sharpton will call the company racist, or somebody will sue saying they weren't hired because they are a woman or are black.

To avoid this, companies are VERY race and gender conscious when hiring: pick the best candidates, and if the crowd isn't diverse enough, sprinkle in a few minorities and/or women into the mix.

I'm not saying that this is good or bad, but it's the way it is.  No client I've ever had (and I've had a lot of brand name clients) gave a shit about a diverse workforce . . . to them, diversity is just some inefficient hassle foisted upon them by lawyers and politicians.

Edit:

The top comment says:

 > That information is kept separate from your application. They just want to see if they are gathering applications in an equal way. If they only advertise the position in the Wall Street Journal and every applicant is white, then they know that they might need to branch out a bit more to get a more diverse pool.

This is really cute, but it is entirely untrue.  Large companies do not care about a diverse applicant pool, they care only about having a legal or PR defense in case they're accused of racism or systematic discrimination.  They care only about token diversity; they want individuals they can point to and say, ""See, we're not bigots, we hired Judy, and she's a African American lesbian Muslim."""	0
"The main idea of this work is to use recursive GANs (RGAN) in order to generate images with multiple layers.
In particular, they propose an architecture that consists of: 1) A generator network which takes as input noise vectors z1, ..., zn where n denotes number of layer; 2) An adversary network which tries to distinguish between real data samples from generated ones. 
They show how their model can be used on several datasets such as: MNIST, CelebA-HQ, LSUN Bedrooms etc... The authors also provide some interesting insights into why RGN works well compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

"Browsers such as Firefox and Chrome implemented standards proposed by the W3C (a body that sets standards for the web) which make a page to look the same across browsers. Microsoft saw these standards as a threat and did not want the web to be interoperable (i.e. one browser can be replaced with another); so it proposed a different set of web standards that favored them and implemented them in Internet Explorer.

Fast forward ten years: Microsoft's clients, especially large organizations, which use Internet Explorer have still retained their old websites but the outside world has moved much faster. Microsoft cannot do both i.e. adapt to the outside world and support its existing clients, so it tries to do a bit of each leading to Internet Explorer being suboptimal.

As for the hatred towards Internet Explorer, its initial lack of support for W3C standards resulted in website designers having to work hard to display a website in Internet Explorer and all other browsers. Although it is not as true today, the hatred continues.

We measure its distance to us by parallax, which is an apparent shift in position of celestial objects as seen through different positions on Earth relative to each other and their common point of observation (the Sun or another distant object). The farther away they are, the greater this effect becomes.  Parallaxes can be measured with great accuracy using telescopes that have two separate lenses separated by several feet so you can see both images at once.   We use trigonometry to calculate distances based upon these measurements. By measuring the angle between our line-of-sight toward the star and some nearby reference stars whose distances are known accurately enough, astronomers can determine the distance to any given star within about 10% error margin. Using parallax measurement techniques, scientists determined that the nearest star lies only 4.3 light years away! This means that if there were no space between the sun and planet Mercury, then one year would last just over 88 days instead of 365	1
"A roadway is placed on top of compacted soils. Those soils are usually only tested for proper compaction once per 100 linear feet. 
Usually the technician testing the soil chooses a relatively compacted ( dense) area to test so they get a passing number.
After the soil’s are compacted they place rebar and concrete on top of the soils. 
Once cars are driving on the roadway they cause vibrations that carry through the concrete and into the soil beneath.
Those vibratios, after a while,  cause The soils to subside in some areas once subsidence occurs the weight of the concrete does the rest.
Gravity pulls the concrete down to fill the hole left by the soil and voilà a pothole is created!

To remedy this problem a contractor will usually remove a workable section around the pothole (usually 3 to 4 ft.² around the pothole) they will remove the soil and replace it. Have a technician tested for proper compaction and then they place the rebar and concrete back on top.

The authors present an interesting approach to generate sound waveforms using deep learning techniques.  The proposed method combines two types of networks:  Autoregressive Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) with Long Short Term Memory units (LSTMs).  This combination allows them to learn both short term dependencies as well as long-term patterns within their data set.   They evaluate their system against several other methods including WaveNet, SampleCNNs, Tacotron2, Melody RNN, and Deep Voice 2.  Their results are impressive showing superiority across all metrics compared to these baselines.  In addition they provide some insight into why certain components contribute more than others towards overall quality.    Overall I think it would be useful if there were additional experiments performed such as:   1)  How does the number of layers affect the final output?  It seems like increasing depth may improve accuracy but could lead to slower training times?	1

"John Pulling was an American captain, vestryman and Patriot who signaled Paul Revere from the Old North Church in Boston before Revere's midnight ride.

In the days before April 18, 1775, Revere had enlisted the help of Pulling and Robert Newman, the sexton of the North Church, to send a signal by lantern to alert colonists in Charlestown as to the movements of the troops when the information became known. In what is well known today by the phrase ""one if by land, two if by sea"", one lantern in the steeple would signal the army's choice of the land route while two lanterns would signal the route ""by water"" across the Charles River (the movements would ultimately take the water route, and therefore two lanterns were placed in the steeple). Pulling was a logical choice to help signal. He was heavily involved with the church, and was a vestryman. If caught with the lanterns, he could provide a meaningful excuse for being in the church.

On the evening of April 18, Pulling hung two lanterns from the steeple of the church for just under a minute, just long enough for the militia in Charlestown to see but not long enough to catch the attention of the British troops occupying Boston.

"The authors propose an interesting idea for automatically discovering task relatedness across layers using tensor decomposition.  The proposed method can be applied to any type of neural network architecture (e.g., CNN) as long as it has multiple output tasks. 
One drawback with their current implementation is that they only consider one hidden layer between input/output pairs which may limit its effectiveness when dealing with complex problems such as image classification where there are several levels of abstraction involved. 

Another issue I have noticed while reading through the manuscript is how do you deal with data imbalance? For example if your dataset contains more samples from class 1 than 2 but you want to train all classes equally well.  

Overall it's good work!

Because they are spoken in different countries with different cultures and customs, which can affect how people talk to each other. For example, some countries have more relaxed rules about speaking quickly or slowly while others do not allow you to interrupt someone when they're talking (which is why Americans often feel that Europeans speak too fast). Also, there may be differences between dialects of one language as well; for instance, French speakers from France might find British accents very difficult to understand because their pronunciation differs greatly even though both varieties belong to the same language family. Because they are spoken in different counties with different culture's and customs'. Some countries don't let you interrupt anyone if you're talking'. And also there's difference between dialect's such as french speakers from france finding british accent hard to understand but still it's part of the same language family. Yes! No! Yes! Yes! Yes!

"It is a combination of three factors. First one is anatomical.  Unlike animals whose vocal folds are found at the larynx, the equivalent organ on the birds, called the syrinx, is found on the trachea fork and spreads to the both bronchus branches. This gives the birds the ability to produce multiple sounds at the same time( in a way they have stereo sound production compared to mono mammals). Due to this, parrots have the anatomical ability to mimic human voice/words without requiring a human like larynx or lips or tongue. 

Second one is intelligence. Parrots are very intelligent birds. Intelligence allows an animal to be more “behaviorally plastic” and let them behave in ways that they dont necessary do in the wild. Plus, parrots can comprehend the meaning of words they speak. So it is not pure mimicking. They, to some extend, know what they are saying and can express them selves. This makes the difference between mimicking and talking. Alex the African grey parrot is the only non human animal to ask a question. He was trained on identifying the colors, numbers and shapes or certain objects. One day he asked his question what color he was and according to the story learned he was gray after it was ~~related 3 times~~ repeated 6 times.

The third and last piece is being social. In the wild parrots live in large flocks. It is important for a parrot to memorize and mimic the unique calls of its flock. This is how members of the flock can find each other and remain together. When we humans become their flock, they have an instinctive urge to memorize and mimic our unique calls, same way they do for their flock. Anyone who owned a parrot knows they love talking when you shout at them from another room, but they tend to be much quieter when you are in the same room. In nature the multiple flocks can share the same area, calls unique to each flock allow each individual to find its flock. When a parrot can’t see their owner, they make sure that the flock-mate can still hear the unique calls of your flock so two of you won’t lose each other.

 As a side note, parrots are not the only birds that can talk. Many corvid species can also speak, although their words are not as clear as, or easy to understand compared that of parrots.


**Edit;Thanks for the upvotes and the gold guys. Its great to see people are interested to learn about these great birds.**

Few little corrections; as some comments pointed out, Alex is the first animal to ask an existential question. This basically means that he asked a question about its own existence. I am sure there are other animals that asked questions, mainly in the form of request, permission etc, but Alex is the only animal to ask a question concerning himself. It is often considered as an significant event because it indicates the existence of ""theory of mind"". Simply, Alex not only Alex showed a high level of self consciousness, he also showed an understanding that other concision beings exist and they might now the answer of a question that he didn't know. I must point out that there is some criticism about how much the question Alex asked was sincere and how much was it him just repeating what he was trained for all his life (Alex was the subject of an experiment where he was trained to identify the shape, size, number and color of objects). Although Alex's ability to ask questions is documented many times.


Second point I want to make is about I might have went a bit overboard with the sentence ""Plus, parrots can comprehend the meaning of words they speak"". A better way of saying this is they can use words with context. They at best have a very limited understating of grammar and even when tif they can form sentences, the grammar is often broken. But Alex did use some simple, grammatically correct, expressions. He would use the term ""wanna go"" and completed it with where he would like to go, like wanna go back, and he would say ""wanna banana"" when he wanted a banana. He could use personal pronouns and spoke differently when referring to himself or others. He also showed the ability to generate words of his own. He was not familiar with apples, when he was introduced to apples, he named the apple ""banerry"". A mixture of banana and cherry that he was familiar with. 

It is important to note that Alex was an exceptional smart parrot. He was probably a genius in gray parrot standards. Since his death 10 years ago, we couldn't find another gray parrot that had an equivalent level of abstract thinking. Wiki page for alex gives a good summery of his accomplishments, some of which are very impressive;

"This paper presents a theoretical and empirical approach to the problem of understanding the expressivity of deep networks.

Random networks (deep networks with random Gaussian weights, hard tanh or ReLU activation) are studied according to several criterions: number of neutron transitions, activation patterns, dichotomies and trajectory length.

There doesn't seem to be a solid justification for why the newly introduced measures of expressivity really measure expressivity.
For instance the trajectory length seems a very discutable measure of expressivity. The only justification given for why it should be a good measure of expressivity is proportionality with other measures of expressivity in the specific case of random networks.

The paper is too obscure and too long. The work may have some interesting ideas but it does not seem to be properly replaced in context.

Some findings seem trivial.

detailed comments

p2 

""Much of the work examining achievable functions relies on unrealistic architectural assumptions such as layers being exponentially wide""

I don’t think so. In ""Deep Belief Networks are Compact Universal Approximators"" by Leroux et al., proof is given that deep but narrow feed-forward neural networks with sigmoidal units can represent any Boolean expression i.e. A neural network with 2n−1 + 1 layers of n units (with n the number of input neutron).

“Comparing architectures in such a fashion limits the generality of the conclusions”

To my knowledge much of the previous work has focused on mathematical proof, and has led to very general conclusions on the representative power of deep networks (one example being Leroux et al again).

It is much harder to generalise the approach you propose, based on random networks which are not used in practice.

“[we study] a family of networks arising in practice: the behaviour of networks after random initialisation”

These networks arise in practice as an intermediate step that is not used to perform computations; this means that the representative power of such intermediate networks is a priori irrelevant. You would need to justify why it is not.

“results on random networks provide natural baselines to compare trained networks with”

random networks are not “natural” for the study of expressivity of deep networks. It is not clear how the representative power of random networks (what kind of random networks seems an important question here) is linked to the representative power of (i) of the whole class of networks or (ii) the class of networks after training. Those two classes of networks are the ones we would a priori care about and you would need to justify why the study of random networks helps in understanding either (i) or (ii).

p5

“As FW is a random neural network […] it would suggest that points far enough away from each other would have independent signs, i.e. a direct proportionality between the length of z(n)(t) and the number of times it crosses the decision boundary.”

As you say, it seems that proportionality of the two measures depends on the network being random. This seems to invalidate generalisation to other networks, i.e. if the networks are not random, one would assume that path lengths are not proportional.

p6

the expressivity w.r.t. remaining depth seems a trivial concerns, completely equivalent to the expressivity w.r.t. depth. This makes the remark in figure 5 that the number of achievable dichotomies only depends *only* on the number of layers above the layer swept seem trivial

p7

in figure 6 a network width of 100 for MNIST seems much too small. Accordingly performance is very poor and it is difficult to generalise the results to relevant situations.

"The main idea of this work is to transfer knowledge between different tasks within one domain using attentional deep architecture.
This approach has been shown effective on several datasets including MNIST dataset (handwritten digits), CIFAR-10/100 dataset(natural images)and SVHN dataset(street view house numbers).
However there are some issues with their experiments that need further investigation before we can conclude whether it works well enough. 
First issue I noticed was how they chose hyperparameters such as learning rate etc.. They didn't mention anything about choosing these parameters so it's hard to tell if those values were chosen carefully.  Second thing which needs more explanation is why did they choose LSTM instead of other types of RNNs? Thirdly,  since they used attention mechanism  at both encoder-decoder layers ,it would be interesting to see how much improvement could have been achieved without attention layer ."	1
"The main contribution of this work is to propose an end-to-end deep multi-task representation learning framework for tensor factorization problems.
In particular, it proposes two novel loss functions that can be used in combination with any existing neural network architectures (e.g., CNNs) as well as other state-of-the-art methods such as GANs.  The proposed method has been evaluated on several benchmark datasets including MNIST, CIFAR-10/100, SVHN, STL-10 etc.. In general, experimental results show that our approach outperforms all competing baselines significantly across different tasks. 
Overall, I think it's very interesting research which makes important contributions towards solving real-world applications using deep multi-task representations. 

Strengths: 
1. It provides new insights into how we should design more effective models for multi-view data analysis; 2. It presents some useful ideas about designing better losses for training DNNs; 3. It shows promising performance compared against many strong baseline algorithms"	1
"I'm from southern Spain, the area with the highest unemployment rate. I can assure you that many families are having a very rough time not being able to eat 3 times a day, play bills or even have a home. The rich are richer but the middle and lower class are much poorer. The government is living off debts and taxes that have constantly been rising. They also sell government properties such as parts of the Air Agency (AENA), the train system... They have also reduced the number of government employees and salaries (I was a former employee). But the politicians have maintained their salary. 

You also have to think that many Spaniards have left Spain to find job, so those are less people accounted for in the statistics. Another factor is that a lot of people from other countries live here due to our culture and climate. Those people (German, English, Russian...) spend a lot of money in Spain, buying houses, boats, cars, dining out, buying luxurious food...stuff that us, the middle and lower class can't afford. I for example have passed from being an accomodated middle class person to a lower end class in three years. Even if outsiders don't notice, we are struggling to get by."	0

"The paper considers the problem of reinforcement learning where the number of policy updates is required to be low. The problem is well motivated and the author provides an interesting modification to the PoWER algorithm, along with variational bounds on the value function (lemmas 3,4) which are interesting in themselves. They also provide numerical results on the cartpole problem and a problem in online advertising with real data. Overall this is a strong, well-written paper. My main reservation is whether it is completely appropriate for ICLR, since the log-concavity assumption the model relies on appear to restrict to simpler models where representations will be not in fact be learned.

Other comments:
- There is a general lack of baselines in the numerical experiment section. I acknowledge this is somewhat of an unusual setting, but even a simple, well-justified baseline would have been welcome. Since cartpole is a relatively simple problem and the advertising dataset is presumably private, perhaps a way to generate a synthetic advertising dataset would have been interesting.

- I was confused by the control variates as constant scalars - are they meant to be constant baselines? And if so, they appear to be treated as hyperparameters -  why are they not learned or estimated?

- There is an interesting section on constrained optimization, but as it is, feels a bit disconnected from the rest of the paper. It appears applicable to the problem of online advertising, but is not mentioned in the corresponding experimental section. Also might be worth adding a citation to the literature of constrained MDPs which develops similar lagrangian ideas."	0
"The differences between a much smaller (4GB flash) drive and a much larger (128GB) drive are likely due to the age of the technology. The smaller one will use manufacturing techniques from several years ago and consequently are cheaper to produce. The larger one uses a much more contemporary process.

However, in drives of similar size (64GB vs 128GB, for example), the price differences are due to manufacturing defects. Let's say the flash memory producer makes 128GB chips.

It helps to picture the memory as being laid out as a grid, like a large city. There will inevitably be defects in the memory cells. The defects cause individual cells to be unusable. But if the defects occur on only the left half of the chip, that entire half can be disabled, leaving the right half usable. Let's say this happens at a rate of 75%. That is, there is a 25% chance you'll get an entire working 128GB chip and a 75% chance that the defects appear on half the chip.

So for every one working 128GB device, you'll get three usable 64GB devices. Therefore, you can (and will) sell the 128GB device at more than twice the cost of the 64GB drive.

"  The search for elementary excitations with fractional quantum numbers is a
central challenge in modern condensed matter physics. We explore the
possibility in a realistic model for several materials, the spin-1/2 spatially
anisotropic frustrated Heisenberg antiferromagnet in two dimensions. By
restricting the Hilbert space to that expressed by exact eigenstates of the
Heisenberg chain, we derive an effective Schr\""odinger equation valid in the
weak interchain-coupling regime. The dynamical spin correlations from this
approach agree quantitatively with inelastic neutron measurements on the
triangular antiferromagnet Cs_2CuCl_4. The spectral features in such
antiferromagnets can be attributed to two types of excitations: descendents of
one-dimensional spinons of individual chains, and coherently propagating
""triplon"" bound states of spinon pairs. We argue that triplons are generic
features of spatially anisotropic frustrated antiferromagnets, and arise
because the bound spinon pair lowers its kinetic energy by propagating between
chains.

"In mathematics, specifically functional analysis, the von Neumann bicommutant theorem relates the closure of a set of bounded operators on a Hilbert space in certain topologies to the bicommutant of that set. In essence, it is a connection between the algebraic and topological sides of operator theory.

The formal statement of the theorem is as follows:

Von Neumann bicommutant theorem. Let  be an algebra consisting of bounded operators on a Hilbert space , containing the identity operator, and closed under taking adjoints. Then the closures of  in the weak operator topology and the strong operator topology are equal, and are in turn equal to the bicommutant  of . 

This algebra is called the von Neumann algebra generated by .

There are several other topologies on the space of bounded operators, and one can ask what are the *-algebras closed in these topologies. If  is closed in the norm topology then it is a C*-algebra, but not necessarily a von Neumann algebra. One such example is the C*-algebra of compact operators (on an infinite dimensional Hilbert space). For most other common topologies the closed *-algebras containing 1 are von Neumann algebras; this applies in particular to the weak operator, strong operator, *-strong operator, ultraweak, ultrastrong, and *-ultrastrong topologies.
 
It is related to the Jacobson density theorem.

Proof 
Let  be a Hilbert space and  the bounded operators on . Consider a self-adjoint unital subalgebra  of  (this means that  contains the adjoints of its members, and the identity operator on ).

The theorem is equivalent to the combination of the following three statements:

(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 

where the  and  subscripts stand for closures in the weak and strong operator topologies, respectively.

Proof of (i)
By definition of the weak operator topology, for any  and  in , the map T → <Tx, y> is continuous in this topology. Therefore, for any operator  (and by substituting once  and once ), so is the map

Let S be any subset of , and S′ its commutant. For any operator  not in S′, <OTx, y> - <TOx, y> is nonzero for some O in S and some x and y in . By the continuity of the abovementioned mapping, there is an open neighborhood of  in the weak operator topology for which this is nonzero, therefore this open neighborhood is also not in S′. Thus S′ is closed in the weak operator, i.e. S′ is weakly closed. Thus every commutant is weakly closed, and so is ; since it contains , it also contains its weak closure.

Proof of (ii)
This follows directly from the weak operator topology being coarser than the strong operator topology: for every point  in , every open neighborhood of  in the weak operator topology is also open in the strong operator topology and therefore contains a member of ; therefore  is also a member of .

Proof of (iii)
Fix . We will show .

Fix an open neighborhood  of  in the strong operator topology. By definition of the strong operator topology, U contains a finite intersection U(h1,ε1) ∩...∩U(hn,εn) of subbasic open sets of the form U(h,ε) = {O ∈ L(H): ||Oh - Xh|| < ε}, where h is in H and ε > 0.

Fix h in . Consider the closure  of } with respect to the norm of H and equipped with the inner product of H. It is a Hilbert space (being a closed subspace of a Hilbert space ), and so has a corresponding orthogonal projection which we denote .  is bounded, so it is in . Next we prove:

Lemma. .

Proof. Fix . Then , so it is the limit of a sequence  with  in  for all . Then for all ,  is also in  and thus its limit is in . By continuity of  (since it is in  and thus Lipschitz continuous), this limit is . Since , PTPx = TPx. From this it follows that PTP = TP for all  in .

By using the closure of  under the adjoint we further have, for every  in  and all :

thus TP = PT and P lies in .

By definition of the bicommutant XP = PX. Since  is unital, , hence . Thus for every , there exists T in  with . Then T lies in U(h,ε).

Thus in every open neighborhood  of  in the strong operator topology there is a member of , and so  is in the strong operator topology closure of .

Non-unital case 
A C*-algebra  acting on H is said to act non-degenerately if for h in ,  implies . In this case, it can be shown using an approximate identity in  that the identity operator I lies in the strong closure of . Therefore, the conclusion of the bicommutant theorem holds for .

"We study the phase diagram and critical behavior of an anisotropic system consisting of Nx × Ny spins on a square lattice, where each spin is described by the two-dimensional XY model. We find that there are three phases depending on the values of J1 / J2 (J2 > 0); ferromagnetic state for small J1 / J2 , spiral state for intermediate J1 / J2 , and paramagnetic state for large J1 / J2 . The transition between these states belongs to the universality class of the Ising model. In particular we show that the spiral state has a nontrivial structure which can be regarded as a superposition of ferromagnetically ordered domains with different orientations. This result suggests that the spiral state may have some relevance to the physics of high-Tc cuprates. 
 
 Introduction 
 
 It was shown recently [1] that the ground-state properties of the twodimensional Heisenberg antiferromagnet with nearest-neighbor interactions depend strongly on whether or not the exchange interaction along one direction vanishes identically. For example, if the exchange interaction along the y-direction vanishes completely, then the ground state becomes ferromagnetic even though it consists only of S = 1/2 spins. On the other hand, when the exchange interaction along both directions does not vanish simultaneously, the ground state is always antiferromagnetic [2] .
 
In this work, we consider another type of anisotropy in the two-dimensional XY model: namely, we assume that the coupling constant along the x-direction is larger than that along the y-direction. As will become clear later, such an anisotropy plays an important role in determining the nature of the ground state."	1
"Imagine your parents gave you $50 for the latest video game. There are other kids selling sub-par lemonade, old video games, comics and orange juice on the block for various prices from $0.05-$0.25 a cup. A days labor earns them anywhere from nothing to a few bucks. And you see these kids with their mud-pies and urinade, and you think to yourself, ""I could totally do better.""

You decide to put your $50 into a lemonade stand instead of a video game. Hell, you even innovate and add sugar to your lemonade (crazzzzzzzzzzy). Now, you can competitively price your lemonade or advertise Johnny mud-pie for a small portion of his daily $0.50 profits, but that'll just detract people from what you're offering. Plus, they might find it mildly annoying.

No, you have bigger plans than that. You're not running a mom-and-pop lemonade stand, you're going platinum. But nobody knows you, everybody knows Johnny mud-pie and Orange Juice Simpson. How do you bring people to the table? *light bulb* You spent $5 getting this lemonade stand started, why not use the remaining $45 for a year of operational costs and give your lemonade out for free.

At a price of nothing, your lemonade quickly becomes the rave. All the other kids have already blown their profits and can't sustain their business models, not when the competition is offering a product for free! Everybody's coming to you. Who would pay $0.20 for pee, besides Pedophile Peter, when they can get your awesome lemonade for nothing?

Over the course of a year, you've built up a popular customer base. You've innovated a bit more, your lemonade now has caffeine in it, and all the local grown-ups stop by your stand instead of going to one of the 30 local Starbucks. Not to mention, everybody that passes through your neighborhood pulls over. Some people even offer a donation, but you lower your shades, give them a half smile, and in the deepest voice you can muster, tell em, ""It's on the house bud."" It's time.

Johnny mud-pies has moved a few blocks away. His mom caught his dad with somebody in their room. IN THEIR ROOM. They're going through a divorce and Johnny spends half his time on the other side of town. He's richer now though, Johnny. He's got money coming in from two separated neglectful parents instead of one neglectful couple. His allowance has tripled as his parents try to buy their way to his teeny little heart. He's thinking of getting back into the game. He's found a new source for mud. But he needs your help. He's seen your business acumen, the way you drove him out of business with a product that wasn't even in the same category.

Johnny offers to buy some space on your lemonade stand to market his product. A year ago, you would've said hell no. Your customers would've said hell no. Hell, you wouldn't grow so quick as new customers would've been put-off. But now you got a steady stream of lemonade junkies. They ain't goin nowhere. Word gets around that Johnny mud-pies is raking in made cash. All of a sudden, several new and old business are popping up around the cul-de-sac and around the block. You started with 50 bucks, you grinded on that chump change for a minute, and now you can't even count the money you're making.

tl;dr It's like cocaine, first hit's free.

Korea is more advanced than us in technology and infrastructure development. They are also investing heavily into their future by building new fiber optic cables to increase speed even further. The United States has been slow on this front because of lackluster investment from companies like Verizon who prefer profits over customer satisfaction. This means that they will only build upgrades when it makes financial sense which can be years down the road. Also Korean people pay higher taxes so there money goes towards improving infrastructure while Americans tend to spend most of our tax dollars on entertainment or other frivolous things instead. Because Koreans pay higher taxes compared to Americans. And Koreans value education highly unlike Americans. In addition, Korea's government spends much less time fighting with each other then ours does. We need to stop spending billions every year on warfare and start focusing on what really matters - Education! Korea is more advanced than us	1

This method works best for people who already know how to bleach their own hair.  This technique does require some patience as well because of all the waiting times involved before applying each new colour.   You may need more than one box of markers depending upon what shade(s) you choose.    If this sounds like too much work, try using an ombre effect instead!   The following are the steps you'll follow when doing this:  Assemble your supplies:    1 pack of permanent markers (red, orange, yellow, green, blue & purple)  A comb Hair ties Bleaching cream Styling gel Blow dryer Combine equal parts hydrogen peroxide and developer into bowl until mixed thoroughly. (Mixture should resemble thick paste.) Mix together 2 tablespoons of bleaching cream per every 10ml of mixture from previous step. Apply bleaching cream evenly over entire length of hair starting at scalp. Leave in 30 minutes under plastic wrap while mixing next part. Rinse off bleaching cream completely after 30 minute wait period. Dry hair completely by blow drying.	1
"We present new radio continuum and H I absorption data for the dwarf irregular galaxy VIRGOHI 21, which is located at the edge of the virgo cluster. The galaxy has an optical diameter of about 1 kpc (0.3 arcmin) and shows no signs of star formation activity. We find that its neutral hydrogen mass amounts to M_HI = 2 x 10^{10} M_sol. Its total luminosity L_TOT = 3.5 x 10^{8} L_SOL corresponds to a B-band absolute magnitude MB = -18.7 mag. This value agrees well with those found by other authors for similar galaxies. From our analysis we conclude that this object may be considered as a candidate for a ""dark galaxy"". It contains only little or even no stars but still possesses a large amount of cold gas. If confirmed, it would provide further evidence for the existence of such objects."	1

The idea is that this will allow more flexibility than traditional approaches, which tend to be limited to linear combinations or other simple transformations.
I think it would have been helpful if they had shown some examples of how their method works on real data sets (e.g., MNIST).  It seems like there should also exist theoretical bounds showing what kinds of problems can be solved with such methods as well as limitations due to combinatorial explosion when trying all possible module configurations.   Finally,  I wonder whether any work has already been done along similar lines? Overall though  it's a very promising direction!

" Also select the options for ""By Owner"" and ""Has Title"".;
, Ask if the person you are speaking to is the legal owner of the car and if they currently have the title to it. You need to speak to the owner of the vehicle.

, Ask the owner if they have documentation to prove that their vehicle would pass any such testing requirements as it sits. Ask for the expiration date on their current registration. You need to know if you'll have to shell out additional monies to bring the car up to specifications before you can register it, should you choose to purchase it.

, Open a new browser and select a service record/accident reporting service website. Key in the Vin number and check for any accidents/repairs that might indicate that the car is likely to have serious mechanical or structural problems. Look for a previous ""Salvage"" title on the vehicle and the most recent odometer reading. It is more difficult to register and insure a vehicle with a ""Salvage"" title, and a vehicle with high mileage (high odometer reading) may require more expensive maintenance and repairs in order to get it to, or keep it in roadworthy condition.

, Make sure you see the vehicle during the daytime and can spare up to an hour to examine it yourself, and have a mechanic check it over for you.

, This will afford you the opportunity to arrive early and observe the owner driving the vehicle into the lot. As they arrive, you should be looking for things like: Is there smoke coming from the vehicle? Is the vehicle making any strange knocking or ticking noises? Do the breaks or tires squeal as they turn into a parking space and come to a stop? When the owner turns the vehicle ignition off, does the car immediately stop running, or does it make odd choking/knocking noises? And finally, what does the owner do when they exit the vehicle (assuming they have not seen you yet)? Does he or she wipe down the car to ensure it looks sparkly? Or does the man or woman grab a bottle out of the car and pop the hood to top off fluids?

, Ask to see the title and registration and compare them with any inspection stickers you may find on the windshields of the vehicle. Note any discrepancies and question the owner about them. If in doubt about who the car is titled and registered to, ask for the owner's drivers license and the vehicle insurance paperwork. If there is any discrepancy, regardless of your feelings about the person or vehicle, find another car. The name should be the same (signature included) on each piece of documentation.

, Walk around the vehicle and visually inspect each tire and wheel well. Look for signs of tire weakness or failure. Run your hand over each tire, feeling for uneven tread wear. (this may indicate poor wheel alignment gone unchecked, or worse, a wracked car frame causing uneven contact between the tires and the ground). Stand at the front corner of each side of the vehicle and look down the body for indications of dents or abnormalities in the body that might indicate a previously damaged vehicle. Such indications might include: wavy body panels, inconsistencies in the paint texture or shine, inconsistent rust patterns, or a suddenly way-too-talkative owner. At the front and rear of the vehicle, kneel down and look under the vehicle. At the front, look for a different paint color or overspray consistent with the vehicle paint color. Look at the inside line between the front and back tire on each side of the vehicle for obvious alignment problems or evidence that the car has been in a frame-wracking crash. Make sure all light lenses are in good condition. At the rear of the vehicle, examine the first few inches of the tailpipe with a flashlight. Look for rust or holes, then examine the length of the pipe for defects such as missing clamps, holes, excessive rust. While you're on your knees, examine the entire undercarriage of the vehicle for rust, failing pieces (even if you're unsure what each piece actually is), and deep scrapes or scratches that indicate significant impact against the underside of the vehicle.

, Often, while you're looking closely at their vehicle, an owner who's neglected to mention problems he or she is aware of, will begin acknowledging, or even pointing out indications of an accident, repairs, or damage done to the vehicle, and provide you with details that can help you decide whether the vehicle is a good investment., Upon opening each cabin door, check to ensure that the windows and locks perform properly and that the glass is solid. Inside the driver's side door, on the frame of the vehicle, you should find a sticker with the vehicle's Vin number stamped on it; compare this number with the Vin number the owner has provided you. Examine the interior, and atop and under the seats for rust (a window, windshield or sunroof leak left unrepaired for a period of time will result in rust on the interior fabrics that is difficult to remove. If you see any, feel along the gasket of adjacent windows for signs of weakness or failure). In the trunk, look for signs of rust, loose compartments, missing or damaged spare tire/tire changing equipment.

, If you spot nothing, get up and start your examination under the hood. Look for any visible sign of a bent frame near the grill area, then examine the radiator for damage to the screen or holes. If nothing else of the engine is visible, ask the owner for any repair and maintenance records they might have and where they have their vehicle serviced. Look for indications in the records that the motor or transmission has been changed.

, Follow them to the service center and observe how the car drives and how the owner drives it. If, at leaving red lights, the owner punches it instead of driving normally, make a note to ask your mechanic to check for potential transmission problems. If the owner has to re-start the vehicle at any time during the drive, be wary. Watch for braking problems and steering problems. If the car looks like it is crabbing down the roadway, like the front and back tires are not in a straight line, the car frame needs thorough inspection for significant frame damage.

, Relate what the owner has told you about the vehicle and ask if what he or she sees is consistent with what you've been told. Ask them if they would buy the vehicle for the price the owner is asking, and how much it will likely cost you to make any necessary repairs to the vehicle.

,, Take a moment to gather your thoughts and process what you've heard and seen regarding the vehicle. If, after a few moments, you feel unsure and hesitant, thank the owner and proceed no further. If, on the other hand, you are certain that this is the right car for you, at nearly the right price, return to the owner and make him or her an offer to purchase the vehicle. Use the information you've gained from your examination of the vehicle and your mechanic's advice to negotiate with the owner until you agree on a purchase amount.

, Make sure you have the title to the vehicle signed and dated by the owner and by you before you leave. Under no circumstances should anyone except you drive the vehicle from this moment forward. The owner will need to make arrangements to return him or herself home, but it would be unwise for you to accompany them, or provide them with a ride.

"The authors present their new concept ""Lie-access"" which seems very interesting but lacks some explanation how it works exactly.
In addition I would like more information about what kind of problems are solved here? What does LANTMs solve better than other approaches?
I think there should be also references to related papers/researchers who did similar research before you introduce your own idea.

"  Stochastic Loewner evolution also called Schramm Loewner evolution
(abbreviated, SLE) is a rigorous tool in mathematics and statistical physics
for generating and studying scale invariant or fractal random curves in two
dimensions. The method is based on the older deterministic Loewner evolution
introduced by Karl Loewner, who demonstrated that an arbitrary curve not
crossing itself can be generated by a real function by means of a conformal
transformation. In 2000 Oded Schramm extended this method and demonstrated that
driving the Loewner evolution by a one-dimensional Brownian motion, the curves
in the complex plane become scale invariant; the fractal dimension turns out to
be determined by the strength of the Brownian motion. SLE fills a gap in our
understanding of the critical properties of a variety of lattice models in
their scaling limits and supplements the result obtained by means of conformal
field theory. In this paper we attempt to provide a simple and heuristic
discussion of some of the important aspects of SLE.

" It will represent who you are throughout the site so something clever will score you points, while something raunchy will only attract the wrong type of people. Most sites also offer a Heading/Catch Phrase/Tag Line that appears in the searches to draw people into your profile. Humor often works best. It engages people by creating a reaction in their mind of laughter, a pleasure-seeking bait of wanting to laugh more if they read what else you have to say. I myself used: “We can always say we met at the supermarket“, or something quirky like: “Seeking out all the toilet paper scrunchers!“

,


A lot of us introverts are camera shy but having a photo is essential for any online dating profile. In most sites you can choose to filter people out without a photo. Whenever someone performs a search for a match, the only details that appear in the search results are your username, age, location, tagline and your photo. So what will make a person take more interest in learning more about you than any of the other 50 profiles in the search result? How attractive they find you. Selecting a photo with someone significantly less attractive than yourself would create the perfect perceptual contrast of increasing your appeal.

, But for the more ethical:


Current photos are ideal. Many people use old photos of their former and more attractive selves. It’s an ingenious idea at the beginning… until you have to meet the person you’re talking with, and have to reassure them that they didn’t sleep in and arrive 20 years late for your date…
More than one photo allows for people to get a more three dimensional idea of what you look like in different contexts. Preferably include at least one head shot and one full body shot.
Be original and grab people's attention to receive higher responses. This could be perfect if you’re a bit shy and don’t want to show a picture of yourself. For example, you could put one picture up of you wearing a costume, or one where you draw a smiley face on a piece of paper and cover your face with it. These kinds of pictures will add a touch of quirky playfulness, while adding a sense of mystery so that people want more.
Details in picking the image will make all the difference. If you’re aiming at attracting geeks or nerds then photos with your glasses on or playing your favorite video games will work wonders. If you’d like an adventurer like yourself, a photo of yourself rock climbing is perfect. Also keep in mind the small things like lighting in the photo, clothes you’re wearing and even the size of your pupils. A psychology study analyzing pupil sizes discovered that we find large pupils more inviting and attractive, just as I mentioned in another article.;
, How often have you seen the same repetitive: “I love to have fun and be spontaneous!!!“, as opposed to what? Not liking to have fun? And saying you’re spontaneous makes it sound planned. Listing sports, movies, music and travel as your interests is uninteresting, most people like a certain sport, movie, song or place to go to. Also, generalizing your tastes by saying for instance “I like all kinds of music” is just a falsified cover-up to make yourself appear that you’re cultured, when in fact you’re actually dispassionate and boring. Writing: “I like to visit India because it’s such an ancient culture rich with variety, spirituality, acceptance and color” would be much more revealing of who you are. Here are some helpful hints:

,


The opening lines are pivotal for the success of your self bio. Just like in many writing formats, how you open your paragraphs will either hook your reader in and entice them to read further or will dull them away. It will be difficult, but craft the first sentence very carefully.

, The length should preferably be around 300 words. The internet generation is one of impatience, nobody likes reading 3-mouse-scroll-downs lengths of text. Too little text however and you’ll come across as empty, lazy, lifeless and boring. Too much and you’re obsessive, psycho and neurotic.

, Spelling is one of the pet-peeves of many. Spelling words correctly makes your writing flow a lot more smoothly, as does using punctuation and new paragraphs. If your reader unconsciously feels the tension of having to decipher your spelling mistakes, then that anxiety will also influence their perception of you. Furthermore, your choice of words can change the meaning of what you want to convey entirely. “I don’t want to die alone” is a common fear. “I want someone to die with” is a suicide pact.

, If you consider yourself caring, instead of writing that, why not share that you enjoy cooking for your parents or coaching your nephews soccer team?

, For instance: what it is you aspire to do in life, what hobbies bring you the greatest joy, what qualities you value in others. The more important things you reveal about yourself, whether favorite movie or favorite ice cream flavor, the more chances someone will read your profile and think: “wow, this person sounds so much like me“.

, Instead of stating: “No old creepy men”, “I’d like someone around my age to be able to grow old with” sounds much more warm and positive. Instead of “No non-christians”, “My religion plays a huge role in my life” is much more welcoming.

, Be unique.

We present an evolutionary algorithm for the problem of mesh numbering, which is to assign integers in the range [0, ..., n-1] to all vertices of a given graph G = (V, E) such that adjacent vertices have consecutive numbers and no two edges share the same pair of endpoints with the same order.  The proposed method uses a population-based approach where each individual represents a valid solution by means of a permutation vector. We show how this representation can be used to efficiently compute fitness values using only local information. In addition we propose several genetic operators to explore the search space. Finally, we report on preliminary results obtained by applying our method to some well-known benchmark instances. Keywords: Graphs, Optimization problems, Evolutionary algorithms, Genetic algorithms. 1 Introduction A common task when working with graphs is to label their nodes or edges with unique identifiers. This process is known as node or edge numbering respectively. For example, it may be required to number the nodes of a road network so that every path between any two points has a unique sequence of labels. Another application arises in circuit design, where one needs to assign unique addresses to components of electronic circuits.	1
"This paper is a follow-up on the NIPS 2016 paper ""Unsupervised learning of spoken language with visual context"", and does exactly what that paper proposes in its future work section: ""to perform acoustic segmentation and clustering, effectively learning a lexicon of word-like units"" using the embeddings that their system learns. The analysis is very interesting and I really like where the authors are going with this.

My main concern is novelty. It feels like this work is a rather trivial follow-up on an existing model, which is fine, but then the analysis should be more satisfying: currently, it feels like the authors are just illustrating some of the things that the NIPS model (with some minor improvements) learns. For a more interesting analysis, I would have liked things like a comparison of different segmentation approaches (both in audio and in images), i.e., suppose we have access to the perfect segmentation in both modalities, what happens? It would also be interesting to look at what is learned with the grounded representation, and evaluate e.g. on multi-modal semantics tasks.

Apart from that, the paper is well written and I really like this research direction. It is very important to analyze what models learn, and this is a good example of the types of questions one should ask. I am afraid, however, that the model is not novel enough, nor the questions deep enough, to make this paper better than borderline for ICLR."	0
"I didn’t work with glue or caulking but I was a machine operator at a sex toy factory so we worked with the silicone or rubber material (still don’t know what it is.) It came in buckets, texture was similar to sand or mud. The sand materiel made “harder” toys and the mud material made more “jelly like” toys. The machines were set at certain temperatures to melt the material and molds would be filled. We would mix the material with the “rejects” as well so no material was wasted.

But to answer your question, last 30 minutes of work we would turn off the machines and have to basically unclog the machine by poking it with a metal stick or else it would dry up and get clogged up. 

Here’s 2 vids of the actual factory I use to work at

Edit: should’ve mention that it was very important that the material was still hot before unclogging cause once it dried up it was a pain to unclog. The next morning we would just start the machine, set it at a high temperature, feed it and let it run for a bit to get rid of any dried excess material that was there the day before. Willing to bet money they do this with glue as well."	0
"Manic Street Preachers, also known as the Manics, are a Welsh rock band formed in Blackwood in 1986. The band consists of cousins James Dean Bradfield (lead vocals, lead guitar) and Sean Moore (drums, percussion, soundscapes), plus Nicky Wire (bass guitar, lyrics). They form a key part of the 1990s Welsh Cool Cymru cultural movement.

Following the release of their debut single ""Suicide Alley"", Manic Street Preachers were joined by Richey Edwards as co-lyricist and rhythm guitarist. The band's early albums were in a punk vein, eventually broadening to a greater alternative rock sound, whilst retaining a leftist political outlook. Their early combination of androgynous glam imagery and lyrics about ""culture, alienation, boredom and despair"" gained them a loyal following.

Manic Street Preachers released their debut album, Generation Terrorists, in February 1992, followed by Gold Against The Soul in 1993 and The Holy Bible in 1994. Edwards disappeared in February 1995 and was legally presumed dead in 2008. The band achieved commercial success with the albums Everything Must Go (1996) and This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours (1998).

The Manics have headlined festivals including Glastonbury, T in the Park, V Festival and Reading. They have won eleven NME Awards, eight Q Awards and four BRIT Awards. They were nominated for the Mercury Prize in 1996 and 1999, and have had one nomination for the MTV Europe Music Awards. They have reached number 1 in the UK charts four times: in 1998, with This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours and the single ""If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next"", in 2000 with the single ""The Masses Against the Classes"", and in 2021 with The Ultra Vivid Lament. They have sold more than ten million albums worldwide.

History

Formation and early years (1986–1991) 
Manic Street Preachers formed in 1986 at Oakdale Comprehensive School, Blackwood, South Wales, which all the band members attended. Bradfield and the slightly older Moore are cousins and shared bunk beds in the Bradfield family home after Moore's parents divorced.

During the band's early years, Bradfield, alongside the classically trained Moore, primarily wrote the music while Wire focused on the lyrics. The origin of the band's name remains unclear, but the most often-told story relates that Bradfield while busking one day in Cardiff, got into an altercation with someone (sometimes said to be a homeless man) who asked him ""What are you, boyo, some kind of manic street preacher?""

Original bassist Flicker (Miles Woodward) left the band in early 1988, reportedly because he believed that the band were moving away from their punk roots. The band continued as a three-piece, with Wire switching from guitar to bass, and in 1988 they released their first single, ""Suicide Alley"". Despite its recording quality, this punk ode to youthful escape provides an early insight into both Bradfield's guitar work and Moore's live drumming, the latter of which would be absent from the band's first LP. The Manics intended to restore revolution to rock and roll at a time when Britain was dominated by shoegaze and acid house. The NME gave ""Suicide Alley"" an enthusiastic review, citing a press release by Richey Edwards: ""We are as far away from anything in the '80s as possible.""

After the release of ""Suicide Alley,"" Edwards joined the band on rhythm guitar and contributed to lyrics alongside Wire. Edwards also designed record sleeves and artwork and drove the band to and from gigs.

In 1990 the Manic Street Preachers signed a deal with label Damaged Goods Records for one EP. The four-track New Art Riot E.P. attracted as much media interest for its attacks on fellow musicians as for the actual music. With the help of Hall or Nothing management, the Manics signed to indie label Heavenly Records. The band recorded their first single for the label, entitled ""Motown Junk"".

Their next single, ""You Love Us"", sampled Krzysztof Penderecki's ""Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima"" as well as Iggy Pop. The video featured Nicky Wire in drag as Marilyn Monroe and contained visual references to the film Betty Blue and to Aleister Crowley. In an interview with then-NME journalist Steve Lamacq, Edwards carved the phrase ""4REAL"" into his arm with a razor blade to prove their sincerity. He was taken to hospital and received seventeen stitches. NME subsequently ran a full-page story on the incident, including a phone interview with Richey on his motivations for doing it. A recording of the editorial meeting discussing whether or not they could publish the image was included as a b-side on the band's 1992 charity single Theme from M.A.S.H. (Suicide Is Painless), featuring Lamacq, the then-editor of NME Danny Kelly and James Brown (who went on to edit Loaded and the British version of GQ).

As a result of their controversial behaviour, the Manics quickly became favourites of the British music press, which helped them build a rabidly dedicated following.
Columbia Records of Sony Music UK signed the band shortly afterwards and they began work on their debut album.

Richey Edwards era: Generation Terrorists to The Holy Bible (1992–1995) 

The band's debut album, Generation Terrorists, was released in 1992 on the Columbia Records imprint. The liner notes contained a literary quote for each of the album's eighteen songs and the album lasted just over seventy minutes. The album's lyrics are politicised like those of the Clash and Public Enemy, with the album's songs regularly switching from a critical focus on global capitalism to more personal tales of despair and the struggles of youth. About the musical style of the album Pitchfork writer Joe Tangari wrote that Generation Terrorists ""walked a weird line between agit-punk, cock rock, romantic melodicism and glam, and was so obviously patterned after the Clash's London Calling that it was actually kind of cute.""

Other tracks combine personal and political themes, implicating a connection between global capitalism and personal struggle; ""Nat West-Barclays-Midlands-Lloyds"" was written as a critique of overseas banking credit policies, but also concerned Richey Edwards' issues involving overdrafts and refused loans. Marc Burrows of Drowned in Sound considered the song to be an accurate prediction of ""global financial meltdown"" and its effects on everyday life. The single ""Motorcycle Emptiness"", meanwhile, criticises consumerism as a ""shallow dream"" that makes human life overtly commercialised. ""Little Baby Nothing"", a duet between Traci Lords and Bradfield, was described by Priya Elan of the NME as a ""perfect snapshot of [female] innocence bodysnatched and twisted"".

The record contained six singles and sold 250,000 copies. The success of 1996's Everything Must Go at the 1997 Brit Awards ensured that sales of Generation Terrorists and subsequent albums Gold Against the Soul and The Holy Bible enjoyed a late surge; the band's debut sold an extra 110,000 copies. The band also made a cover version of the song ""Suicide Is Painless"" which peaked at number 7 in the UK charts, spending 3 weeks in the Top 10, and giving the band their first ever Top 10 hit single.

The group's second album, Gold Against the Soul, displayed a more commercial, grungy sound which served to alienate both fans and the band itself. It was released to mixed reviews but still performed well, reaching number eight in the UK album chart. The album presents a different sound from their debut album, not only in terms of lyrics but in sound, the band privileged long guitar riffs, and the drums themselves feel more present and loud in the final mix of the album. This sound would be abandoned in their next album and as for the nature of the lyrics they also changed, with Edwards and Wire eschewing their political fire for introspective melancholy. According to AllMusic, the album ""takes the hard rock inclinations of Generation Terrorists to an extreme.""

The band also stated that the choice to work with Dave Eringa again was important for this album: ""We finished work in November and then just went straight into a demo studio and we came out about four weeks later with the album all finished. We were all happy with all the songs, we knew what they wanted to sound like, so we didn't want to use a mainstream producer because they've got their own sound and vision of what a record should be like. So we just phoned Dave up and said 'Look, come down, let's see how this works out', and everyone loved what we were doing, so we decided to stay with him.""

The band have described Gold Against the Soul as their least favourite album and the period surrounding the album as being the most unfocused of their career. The band's vocalist and guitarist James Dean Bradfield has said ""All we wanted to do was go under the corporate wing. We thought we could ignore it but you do get affected.""

By early 1994, Edwards' difficulties became worse and began to affect the other band members as well as himself. He was admitted into The Priory in 1994 to overcome his problems and the band played a few festivals as a three-piece to pay for his treatment.

The group's next album, The Holy Bible, was released in August to critical acclaim, but sold poorly. The album displayed yet another musical and aesthetic change for the band, largely featuring army/navy uniforms. Musically, The Holy Bible marks a shift from the modern rock sound of their first two albums, Generation Terrorists and Gold Against the Soul. In addition to the album's alternative rock sound the album incorporates various elements from other musical genres, such as hard rock, British punk, post-punk, new wave, industrial, art rock and gothic rock.

Lyrically the album deals with subjects including prostitution, American consumerism, British imperialism, freedom of speech, the Holocaust, self-starvation, serial killers, the death penalty, political revolution, childhood, fascism and suicide. According to Q: ""the tone of the album is by turns bleak, angry and resigned"". There was also an element of autobiographic subjects, like in the song ""4st 7lb"" where the lyrics clearly tackle Richey's own experience and life. The song was named after 4 stones 7 pounds, or , because it is the weight below which death is said  to be medically unavoidable for an anorexic sufferer.

The title ""The Holy Bible"" was chosen by Edwards to reflect an idea, according to Bradfield, that ""everything on there has to be perfection"". Interviewed at the end of 1994, Edwards said: ""The way religions choose to speak their truth to the public has always been to beat them down [...] I think that if a Holy Bible is true, it should be about the way the world is and that's what I think my lyrics are about. [The album] doesn't pretend things don't exist"".

Ben Patashnik of Drowned in Sound later said that the album in the time of its release ""didn't sell very well, but its impact was felt keenly by anyone who'd ever come into contact with the Manics"", and that it is now a ""masterpiece [...] the sound of one man in a close-knit group of friends slowly disintegrating and using his own anguish to create some of the most brilliant art to be released on a large scale as music in years [...] It's not a suicide note; it's a warning.""

In support of the album the band appeared on Top of the Pops, performing its first single, ""Faster"", which reached No. 16. The performance was extremely controversial at the time, as the band were all dressed in army regalia. Bradfield wore a ""terrorist-style"" balaclava. At the time, the band was told by the BBC that they had received the most complaints ever. The album eventually has sold over 600,000 copies worldwide and is frequently listed among the greatest records ever recorded.

In April and May 1994 the band first performed songs from The Holy Bible at concerts in Thailand and Portugal and at a benefit concert for the Anti-Nazi League at Brockwell Park, London. In June, they played the Glastonbury Festival. In July and August, without Richey Edwards, they played T in the Park in Scotland, the Alte Wartesaal in Cologne, the Parkpop Festival in The Hague and the Reading Festival. During September, October and December there was a headline tour of the UK and Ireland and two tours in mainland Europe with Suede and Therapy?. In December, three nights at the London Astoria ended with the band smashing up their equipment and the venue's lighting rig, causing £26,000 worth of damage.

Edwards disappeared on 1 February 1995, on the day when he and James Dean Bradfield were due to fly to the US on a promotional tour. In the two weeks before his disappearance, Edwards withdrew £200 a day from his bank account, which totalled £2,800 by the day of the scheduled flight. He checked out of the Embassy Hotel in Bayswater Road, London, at seven in the morning, and then drove to his apartment in Cardiff, Wales. In the two weeks that followed he was apparently spotted in the Newport passport office, and the Newport bus station. On 7 February, a taxi driver from Newport supposedly picked up Edwards from the King's Hotel in Newport, and drove him around the valleys, including Blackwood (Edwards' home as a child). The passenger got off at the Severn View service station near Aust and paid the £68 fare in cash.

On 14 February, Edwards' Vauxhall Cavalier received a parking ticket at the Severn View service station and on 17 February, the vehicle was reported as abandoned. Police discovered the battery to be flat, with evidence that the car had been lived in. Due to the service station's proximity to the Severn Bridge (which has been a renowned suicide location in the past) it was widely believed that he took his own life by jumping from the bridge. Many people who knew him, however, have said that he was never the type to contemplate suicide and he was quoted in 1994 as saying ""In terms of the 'S' word, that does not enter my mind. And it never has done, in terms of an attempt. Because I am stronger than that. I might be a weak person, but I can take pain.""

Since then he has reportedly been spotted in a market in Goa, India, and on the islands of Fuerteventura and Lanzarote. There have been other alleged sightings of Edwards, especially in the years immediately following his disappearance. However, none of these has proved conclusive and none has been confirmed by investigators. He has not been seen since.

Manic Street Preachers was put on hold for six months and disbanding the group was seriously considered, but with the blessing of Edwards' family, the other members continued. Edwards was legally ""presumed dead"" in 2008, to enable his parents to administer his estate. The band continue to set up a microphone for Edwards at every live performance.

Everything Must Go to Lifeblood (1996–2006) 
The first album without Edwards, Everything Must Go, was released on 20 May 1996. The band had chosen to work with new producer Mike Hedges, mainly for his work on Siouxsie and the Banshees' single ""Swimming Horses"" that Bradfield rated highly. Hedges had already been approached before to produce The Holy Bible but he wasn't available at the time. Everything Must Go debuted on the UK Albums Chart at number 2, so far the album has gone Triple Platinum in the UK and is their most successful album to date, spending 103 weeks in the Top 100 with the album still in the Top 5 a year after its release. Containing five songs either written or co-written by Edwards the album was released to overwhelmingly positive reviews. Lyrically the themes were different from their previous effort, instead of introspective and autobiographical tracks such as ""4st 7lb"", Wire's predilection for historical and political themes dominates, like the No. 2 hit single ""A Design for Life"". The song was the first to be written and released by the band following the mysterious disappearance of figurehead Richey Edwards the previous year and was used as the opening track on Forever Delayed, the band's greatest hits album released in November 2002.

James Dean Bradfield later recalled that the lyric had been a fusion of two sets of lyrics-""Design for Life"" and ""Pure Motive""-sent to him from Wales by bassist Nicky Wire, while he was living in Shepherd's Bush. The music was written ""in about ten minutes"" and Bradfield felt a sense of euphoria with the result. The song was credited with having ""rescued the band"" from the despair felt after the disappearance of Edwards, with Wire describing the song as ""a bolt of light from a severely dark place"". The album was shortlisted for the 1996 Mercury Prize award for best album and won the band two Brit Awards for Best British Band and Best British Album, as well as yielding the hit singles ""Australia"", ""Everything Must Go"" and ""Kevin Carter"".

Subjects tackled on the album include the tragic life of the photographer Kevin Carter, on the track of the same name, Willem de Kooning and the maltreatment of animals in captivity on ""Small Black Flowers That Grow in the Sky"" (which is a quote from the film The Best Years of Our Lives). The latter track, with lyrics by Edwards, can also be interpreted as an exploration of his mental state before his disappearance; the line ""Here chewing your tail is joy"" for instance may be as much about Richey's self-harm as it is the tormented self-injury of zoo animals. It was their most direct and mature record to date and it established the Manics as superstars throughout the world.

The album has sold over two million copies around the world, and it is still considered one of the finest releases of the decade, a classic album from the 1990s and frequently voted in polls in the category of best albums of all time by many publications.

In 1997 the band performed a special gig at the Manchester Arena for more than 20,000 people. Bassist Nicky Wire said that was the moment he knew that the band had ""made it"". The recording was released as a VHS video on 29 September 1997 and has only been reissued on DVD in Japan.

This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours (1998) was the first number 1 of the band in the UK, remaining at the top of the albums chart for 3 weeks, selling 136,000 copies in the first week and spending a total of 74 weeks in the Album Chart. The title is a quotation taken from a speech given by Aneurin Bevan, a Labour Party politician from Wales. Its working title was simply Manic Street Preachers. The cover photograph was taken on Black Rock Sands near Porthmadog, Wales. Around the world the album also peaked at number 1 in countries like Sweden and Ireland, and it sold over five million copies worldwide.

With their fifth album, the group also had a No. 1 single, ""If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next"". The song's theme is taken from the Spanish Civil War, and the idealism of Welsh volunteers who joined the left-wing International Brigades fighting for the Spanish Republic against Francisco Franco's military rebels. The song takes its name from a Republican poster of the time, displaying a photograph of a young child killed by the Nationalists under a sky of bombers with the stark warning ""If you tolerate this, your children will be next"" written at the bottom. The song is in the Guinness World Records as the number one single with the longest title without brackets. The album also included the hit singles ""You Stole the Sun from My Heart"", ""Tsunami"" and ""The Everlasting"". The Manics won Best British Band and Album awards at the BRIT Awards in 1999. This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours was also shortlisted for the 1999 Mercury Prize and the band received a further nomination in the category of Best UK & Ireland Act in the 1999 MTV Europe Music Awards, where the band performed live the single If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next. In the NME Awards in 1999, the band won every single big prize, Best Band, Best Album, Best Live Act, Best Single and Best Video, nailing also the prize for Best Band in the World Today in the Q Awards 1998.

After headlining Glastonbury Festival, T in the Park and V Festival, the band played the Leaving the 20th Century concert at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff on 31 December 1999, the first concert to be held there, with 57,000 people attending and the final song being broadcast around the world by satellite as part of 2000 Today. The concert is available on VHS and DVD. Subtitled English lyrics, available as an extra, contain errors when compared to the official lyrics in the band's album booklets and in between some of the tracks there are interview clips where the band discusses their history and the songs.

In 2000, they released the limited edition single ""The Masses Against the Classes"". Despite receiving little promotion, the single sold 76,000 copies in its first week and reached number one in the UK Singles Chart on 16 January 2000, beating ""U Know What's Up"" by Donell Jones to the top. The catalogue entry for the single was deleted (removed from wholesale supply) on the day of release, but the song nevertheless spent 9 weeks in the UK chart.

In 2001, they became the first popular Western rock band to play in Cuba (at the Karl Marx Theater) and met with President Fidel Castro. Their concert and trip to Cuba was documented and then released as a DVD entitled Louder Than War. At this concert, they revealed many tracks from their upcoming sixth album, Know Your Enemy, which was released on 19 March. The left-wing political convictions of the Manic Street Preachers are apparent in many of the album's songs, such as ""Baby Elián"" as they comment on the strained relations between the United States and Cuba as seen in the Elián González affair, a hot topic around the album's release.

The band also pays tribute to singer and civil rights activist Paul Robeson in the song ""Let Robeson Sing"", but the song ""Ocean Spray"", which was a single, was written entirely by James about his mother's battle with cancer. The first singles from the album, ""So Why So Sad"" and ""Found That Soul"", were both released on the same day. The final single ""Let Robeson Sing"" was released later. The Manics also headlined Reading and Leeds Festival.

The greatest hits (plus remixes) album Forever Delayed was released in 2002, containing two new songs, ""Door to the River"" and the single ""There by the Grace of God"". Several songs were edited for length (""Motorcycle Emptiness,"" ""You Love Us"", ""Australia,"" ""Everything Must Go,"" ""Little Baby Nothing,"" and ""The Everlasting"") so that more tracks could fit onto the CD (though not listed as edits in the liner notes).

The Forever Delayed DVD was released in 2002 together with the greatest hits CD and photo book that bear the same name, and features all the promo music videos from the start of the band's career released before the DVD. Along with the promo videos, there is a selection of 14 remix videos, where the visual material is taken from clips of the other promo videos as well as backdrop visuals from the band's live concerts.
The album peaked and debuted on the UK Albums Chart at #4.

An album of B-sides, rarities, and cover versions was released in 2003 entitled Lipstick Traces (A Secret History of Manic Street Preachers), which contains the last song the band worked on with Edwards. The album received a far more positive reception from fans than the Forever Delayed greatest hits album, which was heavily criticised for favouring the band's more commercially successful singles. The only recurring criticism of Lipstick Traces was the exclusion of the fan favourite ""Patrick Bateman"", from the ""La Tristesse Durera (Scream to a Sigh)"" single. The band explained that it was excluded mainly because it was almost seven minutes long and simply would not fit on the album.

The band's seventh studio album, Lifeblood, was released on 1 November 2004 and reached No. 13 on the UK album chart. Critical response to the album was mixed. The album was more introspective and more focused on the past, Wire talked about the ghosts that haunted this record and stated that the record was a retrospective: ""The main themes are death and solitude and ghosts. Being haunted by history and being haunted by your own past. Sleep is beautiful for me. I hate dreaming because it ruins ten hours of bliss. I had a lot of bad dreams when Richey first disappeared. Not ugly dreams, but nagging things. Until we wrote 'Design for Life', it was six months of misery. Lifeblood doesn't seek to exorcise Edwards' ghost, though, just admits that there are no answers"". Tony Visconti helped the band produce three songs on the album, which was followed by a UK arena tour in December 2004. ""Empty Souls"" and ""The Love of Richard Nixon"" were the two singles released from the album, both reaching No. 2 in the UK.

A tenth-anniversary edition of The Holy Bible was released on 6 December 2004, which included a digitally remastered version of the original album, a rare U.S. mix (which the band themselves have admitted to preferring to the original UK mix) and a DVD of live performances and extras including a band interview.

In April 2005, the band played several shows as the Past-Present-Future tour—announced as their last for at least two years. The band released an EP entitled God Save the Manics with only a limited number of copies available and given out to fans as they arrived at the venue. After all the copies were gone, the band made the EP available as a free download on their website. In September, the band contributed the new track ""Leviathan"" to the War Child charity album Help!: A Day in the Life.

In 2006 the band received the prize for the Q Merit Award in the Q Awards 2006 and also the 10th-anniversary edition of Everything Must Go was released on 6 November. It included the original album, demos, B-sides, remixes, rehearsals and alternate takes of the album's songs, spread out over two CDs. An additional DVD, featuring music videos, live performances, TV appearances, a 45-minute documentary on the making of the album, and two films by Patrick Jones, completed the three-disc set.

In the 10th-anniversary edition, the band itself claims that they're still fond of the record, and Wire goes further saying: ""I think it's our best record, I am not afraid to say that.""

Send Away the Tigers to National Treasures (2007–2012) 

The band's eighth studio album, Send Away the Tigers, was released on 7 May 2007 on Columbia Records. It entered the official UK album charts at No. 2. Critical response to the album was largely positive, with some critics hailing the album as the band's best in a decade. A free download of a song entitled ""Underdogs"" from the album was made available through the group's website on 19 March 2007.

The first official single released from Send Away the Tigers was ""Your Love Alone Is Not Enough"", which features Cardigans vocalist Nina Persson and according to the band they always had a duet in mind, seeing that the lyrics have a question/reply style to it. According to singer Bradfield, the title was the last line of a suicide note left by the friend of someone close to the group. The second single, ""Autumnsong"", and a third, ""Indian Summer"", were released in August. ""Indian Summer"" peaked at number 22, making it the first Manics single not to chart in the Top 20 since 1994's ""She Is Suffering"". The album sleeve features a quotation from Wyndham Lewis: ""When a man is young, he is usually a revolutionary of some kind. So here I am, speaking of my revolution"".

The band ended up promoting the album with appearances in the summer festivals like Reading and Leeds Festivals and Glastonbury Festival.

The band released a Christmas single, ""The Ghosts of Christmas"", in December. The track was available as a free download on their official website throughout December 2007 and January 2008. In February 2008, the band were presented with the God-Like Geniuses Award at the NME Awards ceremony.

The ninth Manics album, Journal for Plague Lovers, was released on 18 May 2009 and features lyrics left behind by Edwards. Wire commented in an interview that ""there was a sense of responsibility to do his words justice."" The album was released to positive critical reviews and reached No. 3 on the UK Album Chart. However, the cover of the album generated some controversy, with the top four UK supermarkets stocking the CD in a plain slipcase, as the cover was deemed ""inappropriate"". Bradfield regarded the decision as ""utterly bizarre"", and has commented: ""You can have lovely shiny buttocks and guns everywhere in the supermarket on covers of magazines and CDs, but you show a piece of art and people just freak out.""

Several tracks refer to Edwards' time in a couple of hospitals in 1994. Among them is ""She Bathed Herself in a Bath of Bleach"", of which James Dean Bradfield said to the NME: ""There're some people he met when he was in one of the two places having treatment and I think he just digested other people's stories and experiences."" The final track, ""William's Last Words"", has been compared to a suicide note, and although Nicky Wire rejects this suggestion, Bradfield observes, ""you can draw some pretty obvious conclusions from the lyrics."" Wire, who admitted finding the task of editing this song ""pretty choking"", eventually composed the music and sang lead vocals after Bradfield found himself unsuited to the task.

Bradfield commented that Journal for Plague Lovers was an attempt to finally secure the legacy of their former member Richey Edwards and the result was that, during the recording process, it was as close to feeling his presence since his disappearance: ""There was a sense of responsibility to do his words justice. That was part of the whole thing of letting enough time lapse. Once we actually got into the studio, it almost felt as if we were a full band; it [was] as close to him being in the room again as possible.""

Tracks from Journal for Plague Lovers have been remixed by a number of artists, and the Journal for Plague Lovers Remixes EP was released on 15 June 2009. Martin Noble of the band British Sea Power remixed the song ""Me and Stephen Hawking""; Andrew Weatherall remixed ""Peeled Apples"", which he has described as ""sounding like Charlie Watts playing with PiL""; The Horrors remixed ""Doors Closing Slowly""; NYPC remixed the song ""Marlon J.D"" and the EP also features remixes by Patrick Wolf, Underworld, Four Tet, Errors, Adem, Optimo and Fuck Buttons.

On 18 June 2009, the Manics officially opened the new Cardiff Central Library. Wire later said in an interview with The Guardian that the occasion had been a great honour for the band:

On 1 June 2010, the band announced on their homepage that a new album called Postcards from a Young Man would be released on 20 September. James Dean Bradfield said that the album would be an unashamedly pop-orientated affair, following 2009's Journal for Plague Lovers. ""We're going for big radio hits on this one"", he told NME. ""It isn't a follow-up to Journal for Plague Lovers. It's one last shot at mass communication.""

On 26 July, the first single from the new album, ""(It's Not War) Just the End of Love"", was played on the breakfast shows of BBC Radio 2, BBC 6Music, XFm and Absolute Radio. It was released on 13 September. The title had previously been suggested as a working title for the album by Nicky Wire. Three collaborations were also confirmed on the band's website later that day: Duff McKagan would appear on ""A Billion Balconies Facing the Sun"", Ian McCulloch will add guest vocals to ""Some Kind of Nothingness"" and John Cale will feature on ""Auto-Intoxication"". Of the album's lead single, ""(It's Not War) Just the End of Love,"" Nicky Wire claimed: ""I believe in the tactile nature of rock 'n' roll. There's a generation missing out on what music meant to us...You can only elaborate on the stuff that compels you to. But ""It's Not War..."" is kind of saying, ""Alright, we're not 18, but even at 40 the rage is still there"".

Postcards from a Young Man was recorded with producer (and longtime Manics collaborator) Dave Eringa and was mixed in America by Chris Lord-Alge. It was released in a standard version, 2 CD deluxe version, and limited edition box set. The album cover art uses a black and white photograph of British actor Tim Roth.

The album was supported by the Manics' most extensive tour of the UK to date, starting in Glasgow on 29 September 2010. British Sea Power were the support act for the band on the tour. Two further singles were released from the album—the McCulloch-featuring ""Some Kind of Nothingness"" and the title track ""Postcards from a Young Man"". ""Some Kind of Nothingness"" peaked at No. 44 in the UK making it the first-ever Manics single to not make the Top 40 since they signed to Sony in 1991.

The band initially announced that their next album had the working title 70 Songs of Hatred and Failure and would sound very different from Postcards From A Young Man: ""The next album will be pure indulgence. There's only so much melody stored in your body that you can physically get onto one record. It was just so utterly commercial and melodic."" However, Nicky Wire contradicted this in 2011 while doing promotion for their greatest hits compilation National Treasures. When asked why the band was releasing the compilation Wire stated: ""It's just the end of an era. Not the end of a band. We're gonna disappear for quite a long time.""

National Treasures – The Complete Singles was released on 31 October 2011, preceded by the release of the single ""This Is the Day"", a cover of the song by The The. On 17 December 2011, the group performed 'A Night of National Treasures' at O2 Arena in London to celebrate the band's 25 years to date, and enter into a period of hiatus where the eleventh album was written. The band performed all 38 singles, with around 20,000 people in attendance, as well as guest performers including Nina Persson from the Cardigans who sings with the band on the single ""Your Love Alone Is Not Enough"" and Gruff Rhys from Super Furry Animals who sang with the band that night on the track Let Robeson Sing. In April and May 2012, the band embarked on a European greatest hits tour. The compilation was voted by NME magazine as the best re issue of 2011, beating Nirvana's deluxe and super deluxe edition of Nevermind to the top spot.

Despite the ""complete singles"" title, National Treasures does not contain every Manic Street Preachers single. Notable omissions are the band's very first single, ""Suicide Alley"" (1989), ""Strip It Down"" from the New Art Riot EP (1990), for which the band's first promotional video was made, and ""You Love Us (Heavenly Version)"" (1991). For singles originally released as double-A sides, only one song is included: therefore from ""Love's Sweet Exile/Repeat"" (1992) and ""Faster/P.C.P."" (1994), only the first of each pair are included.

On 10 October the band announced via Facebook that a film-interview-documentary about their album Generation Terrorists would be screened at 2012's  Festival as a Welsh exclusive. The film was shown at Chapter Arts Centre on Saturday 20 October, with all profits being donated to Young Promoters Network. The film was made available in the 20th-anniversary re-issue of Generation Terrorists, of which there were five editions:

 Single Disc edition: Original Album
 2 Disc Deluxe edition: Includes Original Album + Demos with DVD of Culture, Alienation, Boredom, Despair (A making of the album)
 4 Disc Limited edition (3,000 copies worldwide): Includes Original Album, Demos, B-Sides, Rarities, CABD DVD + Replica of Generation Terrorist Tour VIP Pass, 10"" Collage by Richey Edwards, 10"" Vinyl LP of a rare Manics Radio Performance and a 28-page book from Nicky Wire's archive.

Also, if the Deluxe edition was purchased from the London record store ""Rough Trade"", then alongside the £20 purchase came a free ticket to see a showing of the CABD film, followed by an acoustic gig with James Dean Bradfield on 6 November.

Rewind the Film to The Ultra Vivid Lament (2013–present) 
In May 2013, the band announced an Australasian tour for June and July, that would see them play their first-ever show in New Zealand. This tour coincided with the British and Irish Lions rugby tour to Australia and the Melbourne concert on the eve of the 2nd Test featured Lions' centre Jamie Roberts as a guest guitarist on ""You Love Us"".

In May 2013 the Manics released information about their most recent recording sessions, saying that they had enough material for two albums; the first would be almost exclusively without electric guitars. The name of the first album and title track was revealed to be Rewind the Film on 8 July. In a statement, the band announced, ""(If) this record has a relation in the Manics back catalogue, it's probably the sedate coming of age that was This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours."" The band also stated via Twitter, ""MSP were in the great Hansa Studios in January with Alex Silva (who recorded The Holy Bible with us). Berlin was inspirational... Sean been playing a french horn in the studio today—sounding wonderful.""

The lead single of the album, ""Show Me the Wonder"", was referred to on their Twitter account, the Manics posted, ""I think 'show me the wonder' is the 1st ever manics single without JDBs electric guitar on-xx."" The single was released on 9 September 2013 to a positive critical reception. The album itself was released on 16 September 2013 and reached No. 4 on the UK Album Chart. The second single of the album ""Anthem for a Lost Cause"" was released on 25 November 2013.

The other album, Futurology, the band's twelfth studio album, was released on 7 July 2014 and it received immediate critical acclaim. The lead single from the album, ""Walk Me to the Bridge"", was released as a digital download on the day of the announcement, on 28 April.

Futurology, according to the band, is an album full of ideas and one of their most optimistic yet, as Wire said to the NME magazine in an interview: ""There's an overriding concept behind 'Futurology' which is to express all the inspiration we get from travel, music and art—all those ideas, do that in a positive way. 'Rewind The Film' was a harrowing 45-year-old looking in the mirror, lyrically. 'Futurology' was very much an album of ideas. It's one of our most optimistic records, the idea that any kind of art can transport you to a different universe.""

The album sold about 20,000 copies in its first week and reached No. 2 on the UK Albums Chart. The title track, ""Futurology"", was the second and final single released from the album on 22 September, the video debuted on YouTube on 10 August. The video was directed by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts winner Kieran Evans, who worked with the band on videos from their previous effort Rewind The Film. The band promoted the album with a tour around the UK and Europe from March to May 2014, they also made appearances in festivals like T in the Park in Scotland and Glastonbury Festival in the summer.

Late in 2014, the band celebrated the release of their seminal album The Holy Bible with a special edition in December, commemorating the 20th anniversary of the album. This edition includes the vinyl edition of the full album, plus a three-CD set, the first CD with the full album remastered for the special release, the second with the US mix remastered and the third including a performance at the Astoria in 1994 and an acoustic session for Radio 4 Mastertapes in 2014. The special edition also contains a 40-page book full of rare photos and handwritten lyrics and notes by Richey and by the band. In the NME Awards 2015, the album won ""Reissue of the Year"".

They also toured the album, playing it in full for the very first time. After the tour in the UK, the Manics took The Holy Bible tour to North America, in April 2015, they played in Washington DC, Toronto, New York, Boston, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Chicago. They also played in the Cardiff Castle on 5 June 2015 with 10,000 fans attending the gig, it was broadcast nationwide by BBC Two Wales.

In August 2015 the Manic Street Preachers nailed the 2 top spots on the best NME covers of all time, as voted by the general public.

James Dean Bradfield and Sean Moore in November 2015 did a charity hike in Patagonia, Nicky Wire did not participate in the event, the band said: ""In November 2015 we will be walking in the footsteps of our Welsh ancestors when we will be part of the Velindre group of 50 people celebrating the 150th anniversary of Welsh settlers arriving in Patagonia with a challenging six-day trek.""

Also in November 2015, the Manic Street Preachers announced that they were going to celebrate the 20th anniversary of their 1996 album Everything Must Go, with their biggest headline show since 1999, in the Liberty Stadium, in Swansea on 28 May 2016, featuring special guests like Super Furry Animals. The album was performed in full, with Nicky Wire teasing ""b-sides, rarities and curios, greatest hits and a few brand-new songs"". Before the final show in Swansea the band played: Liverpool, Echo Arena (13 May), Birmingham, Genting Arena (14 May), London, Royal Albert Hall (16–17 May), Leeds, First Direct Arena (20 May) and Glasgow, the SSE Hydro (21 May). In early 2016 the band announced the European tour of ""Everything Must Go"", they played across Europe, in Finland, Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany. Similar to what happened with ""The Holy Bible"" the Manics released on 20 May, a special anniversary edition for the album, which includes the full album remastered plus the B-sides, a heavyweight vinyl, the 1997 Nynex concert fully restored on DVD, a film about the making of the album, the official videos for the all singles and a 40-page booklet. It was also made available a standard edition with a double-CD featuring only the remastered album and the concert at the Nynex Arena.

The band announced in March 2016 that they would be releasing a theme song for the Wales national team ahead of the UEFA Euro 2016 tournament in the summer, entitled ""Together Stronger (C'mon Wales)"", it was released on 20 May, featuring also a video with the band and the Welsh team, the Manics tweeted: ""It's with great pride we can announce the Manics are providing the official Wales Euro 2016 song – 'Together Stronger (C'mon Wales)'"". All profits from the song went to the Princes Gate Trust and Tenovus Cancer Care. On 8 July the band was at the Cardiff City Stadium to give a home welcome to the Wales football national team after they were knocked out of the UEFA Euro 2016 by Portugal in the semi-finals, the band played a few songs in the stadium including the official theme song ""Together Stronger (C'mon Wales)"". On the next night, 9 July, the Manics headlined a night at the Cornwall's Eden Project, and later the band managed to secure a new recording studio near Newport, Wales. The city's council ensured that only the band can use the studio, there would be an increase on-site parking and a series of soundproofing measures to ensure nearby properties aren't disturbed by noise. To end the summer, the Manics went on to headline another two festivals, Wasa Open Air in Finland in mid-August and in late August the Victorious Festival in Portsmouth. The band also received a nomination in the 25th British Academy Cymru Awards for the best live outside broadcast after their 2015 gig in the Cardiff Castle, celebrating the 20th anniversary of the ""Holy Bible"".

In February 2017 the band revealed a teaser trailer for a documentary entitled Escape from History, charting the band's journey from The Holy Bible, through to the disappearance of lyricist and guitarist Richey Edwards, to the huge success of Everything Must Go. The documentary aired on Sky Arts on 15 April. The band also stated that they would release an album later in that year.

The band released a special edition of their album Send Away the Tigers on 12 May. 2017 marks the 10th anniversary of the record and the Manics said that ""this is a very important album"" in their career. The special edition featured a remastered album as well as B-sides and rarities spread over two discs, plus a DVD which features the band's 2007 Glastonbury performance, rehearsal footage, an album track-by-track, and promo videos.

On 17 November 2017, the band announced that their thirteenth album, Resistance Is Futile, would be released on 13 April 2018. After much delay, the band wrote ""The main themes of 'Resistance is Futile' are memory and loss; forgotten history; confused reality and art as a hiding place and inspiration"", the band say in a statement. ""It's obsessively melodic—in many ways referencing both the naive energy of 'Generation Terrorists' and the orchestral sweep of 'Everything Must Go'. After delay and difficulties getting started, the record has come together really quickly over the last few months through a surge of creativity and some old school hard work."" It is the first album to be recorded at the ""Door to the River"" studio.

In January 2018, Manic Street Preachers signed a publishing contract with Warner/Chappell Music, leaving their longtime home Sony/ATV Music Publishing.

On the album, the Manics launched their first single ""International Blue"" as a download on 8 December 2017. The second single ""Distant Colours"" was released, also as a download, on 16 February 2018. About the first single the band said that there's was certain naive energy and widescreen melancholia on the song that is reflected through the whole album, comparing it to Motorcycle Emptiness. Furthermore, the album focused on ""(...)things that make your life feel a little bit better. Rather than my internalised misery, I tried to put a sense of optimism into the lyrics by writing about things that we find really inspiring."" Said Wire, taking inspiration from David Bowie and seen as almost an escape and a wave of optimism, just like the previous album was described.

On the other hand, ""Distant Colours"" was written by James Dean Bradfield, rather than Nicky Wire, and inspired by disenchantment and Nye Bevan's old Labour. He said: ""Musically, the verse is downcast and melancholic and the chorus is an explosion of disillusionment and tears."" The third single ""Dylan & Caitlin"" was released as a download on 9 March 2018. The fourth single ""Liverpool Revisited"" is about a magical day in the city, Nicky added that: ""It was on the Everything Must Go (anniversary) tour and I got up really early at sunrise to walk around Liverpool, polaroid camera in hand on a balmy day. It sounds clichéd I know, but Liverpool in the sun does take on a hypnotic quality, with the Mersey and the stone."" The band also revealed that they were to support Guns N' Roses during their summer tour. The fifth and final single, ""Hold Me Like a Heaven"", was released as a download on 4 May 2018. Wire said that the song was inspired musically by David Bowie's Ashes to Ashes, something that the band wanted to write about, and Nicky thinks that this the closest that the band is going to get, sharing also that lyrics were informed by the work of Philip Larkin.

The album sold around 24,000 copies in the first week, entering the UK Albums Chart at number 2, despite being number 1 during the week. It was the highest new entry on the chart, and on physical sales the album peaked at number 1, both on CD and vinyl.

In October 2018, the band announced a twentieth-anniversary collector's edition re-release of This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours. It was made available on digital, CD, and vinyl, with the CD edition featuring bonus demos, live rehearsal recordings, remixes, and B-sides. The album was launched on 7 December 2018 and to promote it, the band went on tour in Spring and Summer 2019, performing the album in full alongside other content.

In March 2020, the Manics announced a deluxe reissue of their Gold Against the Soul album for release on 12 June 2020. Bonus content included previously unreleased demos, B-sides from the era, remixes, and a live recording, while the CD was released alongside a book of unseen photographs from the era with handwritten annotations and lyrics from the band. The next day, the unnamed follow-up album to Resistance is Futile, their fourteenth overall, was confirmed to NME alongside Bradfield's second solo album. The group's album, including a track called ""Orwellian"", was described as ""expansive"" and is due for release in Summer 2021.

On 14 May 2021, the Manics announced the title of their fourteenth studio album: The Ultra Vivid Lament.  The first single from the album, ""Orwellian"", was released on the same day. ""The Secret He Had Missed"", the second single from the album, was released on 16 July 2021. The Ultra Vivid Lament was released on 10 September 2021 and received generally positive reviews from critics: on Metacritic, the album has a weighted average score of 78 out of 100 based on 12 reviews, indicating ""generally favorable reviews"".  The album sold 27,000 copies in the first week, granting the band their second UK Number 1 album as they narrowly beat Steps to the number 1 spot.

Solo work 
In late 2005, both Bradfield and Wire announced that they intended to release solo material before a new album by the band. A free download of Nicky Wire's debut solo offering I Killed the Zeitgeist was posted on the band's website for just one day, Christmas Day 2005, while ""The Shining Path"" was released exclusively on iTunes for download. Also, a promotional album sampler had been sent out to the press and certain other people which included ""I Killed the Zeitgeist"", ""Goodbye Suicide"", ""Sehnsucht"", and ""Everything Fades"".

The album was officially released in September 2006. It charted at No. 130 in the UK. The sound of the album, which Nicky referred to as his ""nihilistic anti-everything album"", was inspired by, among others, Neu!, the Plastic Ono Band, Einstürzende Neubauten, the Modern Lovers, Richard Thompson and Lou Reed. Only one official single was released, ""Break My Heart Slowly"", which charted at No. 74. Nicky toured small intimate venues across the UK with his band the Secret Society.

Bradfield's solo album, The Great Western, was released in July 2006, to positive reviews from critics. It reached No. 22 in the UK. The sound of the album was inspired by, among others, Jeff Beck, Badfinger, Simple Minds and McCarthy. Two singles were released: ""That's No Way to Tell a Lie"" (No. 18) in July, which was also the background music to the BBC's Match of the Day's 'Goal of the Month' competition, and then ""An English Gentleman"" (No. 31) in September. The latter is in remembrance of the first Manics manager Philip Hall, who died from cancer in 1993 and to whom The Holy Bible had been dedicated. The initial pressings of the red 7"" single were made with black vinyl, some of which were sent out to distributors by mistake. James toured the album with a band that included Wayne Murray, who would subsequently play the second guitar for Manics live performances. James's solo gigs featured covers of the Clash songs ""Clampdown"" and ""The Card Cheat"", both from the album London Calling.

In a later interview, when the band were collectively asked what they had learned from making a solo album, Sean Moore dryly quipped ""Not to do one"".

In March 2020, Bradfield was confirmed to be working on a second album while the band took a short break, while Wire was also considering more solo content. That June, two tracks by Bradfield, ""There'll Come a War"" and ""Seeking the Room With the Three Windows"", were released digitally. The album title was announced as Even in Exile the next week alongside the launch of its first single, ""The Boy From the Plantation"", and the album was released on 14 August 2020. The album was generally well-received and peaked at no.6 in the UK Albums Chart

Collaborations and covers 

The band released a split single in 1992 with the Fatima Mansions, a rock cover of ""Suicide Is Painless"", which became their first UK Top 10 hit. They have recorded many cover versions of songs by other artists, primarily as B-sides for their own singles. Bands and artists to whom the group have paid tribute in this way include the Clash, Guns N' Roses, Alice Cooper, Happy Mondays, McCarthy, Chuck Berry, Faces and Nirvana.

The band's first musical appearance since Edwards' departure was recording a cover of ""Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head"" for The Help Album, a charity effort in 1995 in support of aid efforts in war-torn Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The Lightning Seeds' song ""Waiting for Today to Happen"", from their fifth album, Dizzy Heights (1996), was written by Nicky Wire and Ian Broudie. That same year, James Dean Bradfield and Dave Eringa produced Northern Uproar's first single, ""Rollercoaster/Rough Boys"". The 808 State song ""Lopez"" (1997) features lyrics by Wire and vocals by Bradfield. It is featured on their greatest hits album, 808:88:98. Kylie Minogue's sixth album, Impossible Princess (1997), features two songs co-written and produced by the Manics: ""Some Kind of Bliss"" (Bradfield, Minogue and Sean Moore) and ""I Don't Need Anyone"" (Bradfield, Jones and Minogue) were produced by Bradfield and Dave Eringa. Bradfield provided backing vocals, bass guitar and production for the Massive Attack song ""Inertia Creeps"" (1998), which features on their successful third album, Mezzanine. Patrick Jones's album of poetry set to music, Commemoration and Amnesia (1999), features two songs with music written by Bradfield: the title track and ""The Guerilla Tapestry"". Bradfield plays the guitar on both songs. Furthermore, the track ""Hiraeth"" features a section called ""Spoken Word"", in which Nicky Wire talks about Welsh identity.

In February 2006, the band contributed a cover version of ""The Instrumental"" to the album Still Unravished: A Tribute to the June Brides.

In February 2008, the Manics covered Rihanna's hit pop song ""Umbrella"". Their version appeared on a CD titled NME Awards 2008 given away free with a special souvenir box-set issue of NME magazine, which went on sale 27 February. Additionally, the Manics' version of the song was made available on iTunes from 5 March 2008. Despite being chart-eligible (it reached number 47 in the UK), the release was not intended as an official single. Two further versions (the Acoustic and Grand Slam mixes) were later made available on iTunes and now comprise a three-track Umbrella EP.

James Dean Bradfield and Nicky Wire contributed an original song, ""The Girl from Tiger Bay"", to Shirley Bassey's 2009 studio album, The Performance.

Musical style and influences 
Manic Street Preachers' music has been variously described as 
alternative rock, Britpop, hard rock glam rock, pop rock, punk metal, and punk rock.

The band have stated that the Clash were ""probably our biggest influence of all"". When they saw them on television, ""we thought it was fantastic and got really excited. They were the catalyst for us"". In addition, they have cited artists including Aerosmith, Alice in Chains, Electric Light Orchestra, Rory Gallagher, Gang of Four, Guns N' Roses, Joy Division, Magazine, PiL, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Skids, Bruce Springsteen, and Wire, as influential or inspirational to their music. Bradfield's guitar hero is guitarist John McGeoch: ""He taught me, you can have that rock'n'roll swagger, but still build something into it that's really unsettling, and can cut like a razor blade"".

Alluding to the band's early relationship with Britpop, Cam Lindsay of Canadian music publication Exclaim! opined that ""Britpop was rising, the Manics were offering the polar opposite: a bleak, uncompromising work that wanted nothing to do with the party"".

" You can find it at your local home improvement store or online. How much you buy will depend on which appliances you plan on covering.


Stainless steel contact paper is plastic-based, so it cannot withstand heat. It is not suitable for surfaces that get hot, such as stovetops.;
, Having someone help you will not only make your work go by quicker, but also make it easier. You will also get a nicer finish with fewer wrinkles and air bubbles.

, This is very important. If there is any dirt or grease on your appliance, the contact paper may not stick. Use a high-quality appliance cleaner that can cut through grease, and scrub your appliance clean. Be sure to wipe it dry with a clean cloth afterwards.

, This will ensure that your lines are straight and even. If you are covering a very wide appliance, you may need to cut two strips of contact paper.


The grain on the finished piece will be running vertically. If you want the grain to be running horizontally, cut your contact paper accordingly.

, It will take a while, but this will lessen the chances of wrinkles or bubbles forming.

, If you are covering an appliance door, make sure that there is enough contact paper hanging over the edge to cover the side. This will typically be around 2 inches (5.08 centimeters).Have a friend or family member hold the rest of the contact paper away from the appliance's surface; this will prevent wrinkles and air bubbles.

, If you don't have a credit card, you can use any other thin, plastic tool, such as a scrapper or spatula. Avoid anything made out of metal, as this can tear the contact paper.


For added security, consider wrapping the credit card in a thin cloth to further prevent any rips or tears., Keep doing this until you reach the bottom of your appliance. If you get any air bubbles, push them to the side of the appliance, or carefully lift the contact paper away and smooth it down again.If you need to use a second sheet of contact paper, overlap the two edges slightly., If you are covering an appliance door, you will have some excess contact paper hanging over the edges. Carefully flatten these flaps down onto the sides of your appliance's door. Run the credit card from front to back in short rows. Start from the top of the door, and work your way towards the bottom.

, Simply trim the excess away using a sharp craft blade.

"TL;DR - It's a little difficult to know actually.

First it is a draft text. Negotiations like these go through dozens if not hundreds of draft texts. Each one can change things drastically - or just be updated punctuation. This could be one which has been tossed, or one which is about to be released as the official version. No way to know really from what I've seen.

Second, These treaties often have a huge amount of lee-way. This allows Pro-Copyright parties to claim victory and Anti-Copyright Parties to claim the sky is falling. An example of this might be text which states ""And the Government shall take all reasonable actions to enforce the Copyright Provisions laid out in the above."" 

A reasonable action would vary from state-to-state. In Canada, for example, jail time for copyright infringement is unlikely to be found constitutional (IMO). More likely the punishment wouldn't vary much from the current laws in Western Countries - these sections are mostly aimed at Africa/Third world places where infringement is rampant and no controls are enforced. It also ""sets the bar"" for countries looking to join the TPP by providing some guidelines to work by. 

The biggest implication is that Copyright laws may be extended so that works gain even more copyright protection. Reddit is (unlike most of the other assertions) broadly correct that copyright at this point is a harmful mechanic in society. Without getting into a rant, TPP or similar treaties all generally see an alignment ""upwards"" of standards within member nations. A good example of this is Canada, when it signed a Free Trade Agreement with the EU, added two years of Patent protection to medicine so that it and the EU were the same. You could expect similar provisions within the TPP to avoid any state undermining others. 

This is all very broad, but that is because I wouldn't get into the sky-is-falling basket until you have a real text in hand. Understand that Governments negotiate in private to avoid this sensation - for example, one provision might look very deadly alone, but your Government may only have agreed to it because you were gaining several other concessions for it which seem mild and garnish no attention. 

I know you don't want links, but I would recommend reading the top entry on this blog: _URL_0_

Michael Geist is a Law Professor at the University of Ottawa and holds a view Reddit would generally agree with. I highly recommend giving it a read as it is relatively brief.

"  We study numerically finite-size corrections in scaling relations for
roughness distributions of various interface growth models. The most common
relation, which considers the average roughness $<w_2>$ as scaling factor, is
not obeyed in the steady states of a group of ballistic-like models in 2+1
dimensions, even when very large system sizes are considered. On the other
hand, good collapse of the same data is obtained with a scaling relation that
involves the root mean square fluctuation of the roughness, which can be
explained by finite-size effects on second moments of the scaling functions. We
also obtain data collapse with an alternative scaling relation that accounts
for the effect of the intrinsic width, which is a constant correction term
previously proposed for the scaling of $<w_2>$. This illustrates how
finite-size corrections can be obtained from roughness distributions scaling.
However, we discard the usual interpretation that the intrinsic width is a
consequence of high surface steps by analyzing data of restricted
solid-on-solid models with various maximal height differences between
neighboring columns. We also observe that large finite-size corrections in the
roughness distributions are usually accompanied by huge corrections in height
distributions and average local slopes, as well as in estimates of scaling
exponents. The molecular-beam epitaxy model of Das Sarma and Tamborenea in 1+1
dimensions is a case example in which none of the proposed scaling relations
works properly, while the other measured quantities do not converge to the
expected asymptotic values. Thus, although roughness distributions are clearly
better than other quantities to determine the universality class of a growing
system, it is not the final solution for this task.

"Baking powder is the common name of sodium bicarbonate, which has been used as baking soda since it was discovered in 1777 by British chemist James Baker (1728–1799). The term ""baking powder"" refers to any mixture that contains both baking soda and another acidic ingredient such as cream of tartar or citric acid; however, most commercial mixtures contain only one type of acidifier along with baking soda.  Baking powders are commonly added during mixing doughs before they rise because their alkaline properties neutralize acids produced from yeast fermentation.   In addition to its use in cooking/baking applications, baking powder can be found on store shelves under various brand names including Alka-Seltzer Plus, Tums, Rolaids, Maalox, Pepcid Complete, Zantac, and Excedrin Migraine Headache Relief Tablets.

"John Edward Michael Moore, Baron Moore of Lower Marsh,  (26 November 1937 – 20 May 2019) was a British Conservative Party politician who was Member of Parliament for Croydon Central from February 1974 until 1992. During the Premiership of Margaret Thatcher he enjoyed a meteoric rise through the ranks of government, which culminated in his serving as a Secretary of State in the Cabinet from 1987 to 1989. For a time, he was considered a rising star of his party and a potential leadership contender.

Moore was particularly noted for his ""filmstar good looks"" and an American background. Moore's wife was American and he had lived for several years in the USA. He brought aspects of American corporate culture to government and was reported to speak with a slight American accent. His first political experience was as a Democratic Party organiser in Illinois during the early 1960s.

Moore's fortunes in government waned after 1987 when he was made responsible for the highly sensitive portfolios of health and social security. His earlier success had been as a facilitator of the Thatcher government's privatisation programme. In this capacity he became known as ""Mr Privatisation"". When Moore attempted to extend this concept into the management of the National Health Service and the wider provision of social services, he encountered opposition from all sides. After losing credibility he was effectively demoted in 1988 (through loss of the health portfolio) and then sacked from his cabinet post in 1989.

Moore left the House of Commons in 1992, subsequently holding a number of corporate directorships and chairmanships.

Early life
Moore was born in Kentish Town, London. His father was a factory worker who later became a publican. He attended the Licensed Victuallers' School in Slough, an independent school supported by his father's trade body. After leaving school, Moore undertook two years of National Service from 1955 to 1957. He served with the Royal Sussex Regiment in Korea and won a temporary commission.

He enrolled at the London School of Economics in 1958, and followed a three-year degree course. He was active in student politics, and held the position of President of the LSE Students' Union. During this time he met fellow student Sheila Tillotson. Moore accompanied Tillotson back to her native Chicago after the two had both completed their studies. Here the couple married in 1962 and Moore found work initially as a financial analyst with a Chicago investment bank. He became a stockbroker, and achieved a senior position at the Chicago office of the Dean Witter brokerage. Dean Witter catered to a mainly middle-class clientele, with the typical client holding only a modest portfolio of stock.

While in Chicago, Moore became a Democratic Party activist and served as a ""precinct captain"". In this capacity he gained experience of American political campaigning which he later applied in the UK. He was reportedly much impressed by President John F. Kennedy, and adopted him as a role model.

Moore returned to the UK in 1968, and took up an appointment in London as Chairman of Dean Witter (International). The Moores set up residence in the suburb of Wimbledon where their three children (one daughter and two sons) were born. Moore became active in local Conservative politics and was elected to serve as a Councillor in the London Borough of Merton in 1971. He initially gave the impression of being a liberal conservative. For example, he opposed the withdrawal of free school milk from the Borough's children which was happening as the result of the government budget cuts policy.

In October 1973, he was adopted as the prospective Conservative parliamentary candidate for the Croydon Central constituency. At this time he was described as being ""an investment banker and stockbroker, age 36"".

Early political career
Croydon Central was a new constituency, and was initially very marginally Conservative. Moore won the seat in the February 1974 general election by a majority of 1,300 votes over Labour. His majority was reduced to 164 in the October 1974 election. However, he was able to strengthen his position in the constituency; the last time he contested the seat (in the 1987 election) he achieved a majority of over 10,000. His wife, Sheila, acted as his constituency secretary, speech writer and political adviser. She combined her duties in this regard with studying for a law degree and acting as a local magistrate. Observers commented that Sheila was very much the driving force behind his rise in politics.

Moore projected the image of a young, vigorous politician. He would usually rise at 05:30 and be at his desk by 07:00. He was a member of the House of Commons football team and the House skiing team. It is reported that his wife ""... kept him on a strict regime of camomile tea, decaffeinated coffee and health food...."" He was frequently seen jogging in the early morning in the Westminster area, and was reported to spend 30 minutes each day on an exercise bicycle. Conservative MP Julian Critchley described him as being;

Handsome, with the sort of looks that would have appealed to J. Arthur Rank, personable and polite, he looks ten years younger than his 49 years.

Margaret Thatcher appointed Moore as one of five Conservative Party vice-chairmen in March 1975, shortly after she became Conservative leader. Moore's remit was ""youth"". He held this position until the Conservatives were returned to office in 1979, at which time he was appointed as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Energy. In this capacity, one of his main duties was responsibility for the nationalised British coal industry.

After the 1983 general election, Moore was appointed Economic Secretary to the Treasury under Chancellor Nigel Lawson. At the Treasury, Moore was charged with fronting government policy on privatisation. Most notably, he oversaw the privatisation of British Telecom in 1984 and that of several other major utilities supplying gas, electricity and water. The privatisation of state-owned industries was a major feature of the Thatcher governments. These privatisations were popularised by small parcels of shares in the privatised entities being made available to members of the public at deeply discounted prices. This promoted a form of popular capitalism along the lines of the Dean Witter business model. Moore gained an extremely high profile and became known as ""Mr Privatisation"".

Cabinet career
Moore joined Mrs Thatcher's Cabinet in 1986 as Secretary of State for Transport. His tenure of office at Transport was brief but coincided with the completion of major developments such as the M25 London orbital motorway and the privatisation of British Airways. The capsizing of the Herald of Free Enterprise car ferry outside Zeebrugge harbour on 6 March 1987 gave Moore considerable media exposure. These events served to raise Moore's profile even further and he played a prominent campaign role in the 1987 general election.

... what probably clinched his promotion to the DHSS yesterday was his TV performance in the party political broadcast that attacked the loony left. It was Thatcher herself who suggested that Moore be used on it. The broadcast was, according to one observer, considered ""sharp, nasty – and effective"".

By now, Moore was being widely spoken of as a future Prime Minister. The journalist Brian Walden wrote ""... he has future Tory leader written all over him"". After the 1987 election he was appointed as Secretary of State for Health and Social Services. In this capacity he was responsible for the National Health Service's £66 billion annual spend, and the payment of over £50 billion annually in the form of social security benefits. These were highly sensitive portfolios that were intended to be very much at the centre of policy initiatives in the 1987 government.

However, there were some early misgivings about the appointment. Describing Moore's earlier career in government, Julian Critchley said, ""The script had been written for him, and he had only to learn his lines"". Other commentators noted that his previous experience had been in implementing policy rather than in creating policy. In 2012 David Waddington, Mrs Thatcher's former Chief Whip and Home Secretary published a memoir of his time in government ('Dispatches') in which he reported that Thatcher had a weakness for ""a good-looking fellow"" when it came to making government appointments. ""Once or twice she ... wished to have some good-looking fellow promoted who was known to be useless. ...  He was a fine-looking chap but no else thought he was anything like up to the job."" Waddington declined to name the people he referred to but many commentators stated that Moore was one clear beneficiary of this personal foible.

Once established in his new job, Moore delivered a series of speeches on policy in the social services. These speeches appeared to indicate a move to a healthcare system based on private insurance, similar to the American model. Specific proposals included making private healthcare insurance contributions tax-deductible, and allowing nurses' wage rates to be established by local bargaining rather than by central negotiation. Moore quickly encountered opposition from various interest groups, including the Royal College of Physicians. Many Conservative backbench MPs had misgivings about what was being proposed. Furthermore, some of the speeches suggested that Moore was positioning himself to be leader of the Conservative Party. During a visit to the USA in October 1987, he delivered a speech to the Mont Pelerin Society in which he appeared to suggest that he had been the prime mover behind privatisation in the UK. This displeased his fellow Ministers and other senior Party figures.

Moore did not seem to engage comfortably in the public estimate procedures by which departmental spending budgets were set. The then Chief Secretary to the Treasury, John Major, was reported to have found Moore to be ""a soft touch"". The then Health Minister, Edwina Currie, is reported to have described Moore as being ""useless"". An entry in her diary dated January 1988 reads: ""It became apparent during the first ten days ... that Moore just didn't know what to do"". Moore found difficulties in his relationships with senior civil servants. Not all the latter were comfortable with a working day that started at 07:00. Moore's wife (and political adviser), Sheila, had clashes with civil servants, and Moore was privately warned that she did not understand the British way of doing things. It is believed that Sheila may have drafted some of Moore's more controversial speeches.

A 1987 Cabinet Office memo written by Moore stated that the Government had adopted a Policy of not accepting any direct responsibility for the Contaminated Blood Scandal. It was unearthed and made public in 2017 with many of those affected by the scandal alleging a cover-up.

In November 1987, Moore was struck down with bacterial pneumonia. He initially tried to ignore the illness and attended a cabinet meeting before he had recovered. During the meeting he became unconscious. He was subsequently admitted to the Parkside Hospital in Wimbledon. The fact that this was a private clinic owned by a German healthcare company (reportedly charging patients up to £2,000 per day) attracted bad publicity. Union leader Rodney Bickerstaffe stated ""How can a social services secretary claim to care about the National Health Service when he does not even trust his own health care to an NHS hospital?"".

End of political career
After two months' absence due to illness, Moore returned to work. But by now his political prospects were much diminished. The Department of Health and Social Security was split into two separate ministries, with Kenneth Clarke becoming Secretary of State for Health on 25 July 1988. Moore remained in the Cabinet as Secretary of State for Social Security for a further year. However, his credibility was further damaged by speeches in which he appeared to suggest that poverty had been abolished in modern Britain. His attempt to target state assistance towards poorer families while freezing child benefits provoked a major rebellion by Conservative backbench MPs.

Moore was sacked from the cabinet in July 1989. Most commentators at the time considered him to have been a weak politician who had been promoted beyond his ability.

He was written off by one Tory as 'like a frightened rabbit mesmerised by oncoming headlights'.

He gave up his parliamentary seat at the time of the 1992 general election. After leaving government Moore held a number of directorships with large concerns, including Credit Suisse Asset Management and Rolls Royce. In 2010 he retired as Chairman of the Monitor Group.

After leaving the Commons in 1992, Moore became a life peer as Baron Moore of Lower Marsh, of Lower Marsh in the London Borough of Lambeth. A BBC feature in August 2011 reported that after 20 years in the House of Lords, Moore had still to make his maiden speech. Between his sacking from the Cabinet in 1989 and stepping down from the House of Commons in 1992 his only contributions were in two transport debates.

While he worked behind the scenes as a political operator he was very effective ... but he was suddenly thrust into the spotlight in the mammoth task of defending the government on the issues of health and social security ... and he just bombed

"The following is the list of episodes from Griffin Newman's The Grind, which aired on Fox Sports Net in 2002 and 2003.
Episode 1 - No Holds Barred (2002)
In this episode, we meet Griffin Newman as he prepares to fight his first professional boxer at Madison Square Garden against former world champion James Kirkland.  We also see how much work goes into preparing him physically before each match.   This was filmed during the summer months when Griffin trained daily under the supervision of trainer Mike Tyson's personal trainer Kevin Jackson.    Episode 2 - A Fighting Chance  (2003)"	1
"The authors present the results of their study on the influence of temperature fluctuations in the Earth's core on its magnetic field. They show that these fluctuations can be described by an oscillating function with a period of about 1000 years, which is close to the observed periods of geomagnetic reversals and excursions. This result suggests that the origin of such phenomena may lie in the dynamics of the Earth's core rather than in external factors. 
 
 In this work we consider the effect of temperature fluctuations in the Earth’s core on its magnetic field using a simple model based on the concept of “thermal micropulses” (TMP). We assume that TMPs are generated at random times within some time interval $[t_0, t_1]$ and have different amplitudes $A_i$ and durations $\Delta t_i$. These pulses cause changes in the heat flux through the CMB and lead to variations in the convective flow velocity inside the fluid core. As a consequence, they produce perturbations in the magnetic field of the Earth. To describe the evolution of the magnetic field during one cycle of TMP generation, we use the induction equation for the vector potential $\mathbf{A}$ together with the continuity equation for the density of electrical current $\mathbf{J}$. For simplicity, we neglect the effects of rotation and stratification of the fluid core as well as the presence of the liquid outer core. Our analysis shows that the solution of the problem has two types of singularities corresponding to the so-called “secular” modes. One type corresponds to the case when all TMPs occur simultaneously; another occurs if only one pulse appears during each cycle. It turns out that both solutions correspond to periodic functions with characteristic periods $T_s = 2\pi/\omega_s \sim 1000$ yr. Thus, our results suggest that the origin of geomagnetic reversals or excursions could be related to the dynamics of the Earth’s core rather than to external factors."	1
"This article presents new ideas about how to understand the difficulty of training deep networks; it also provides some interesting experimental observations along its way. 
 
 This research makes several contributions. 

First, it shows theoretically why rectification helps training: Rectifiers create a smoother objective function than sigmoids; thus there can be fewer saddle points where gradients vanish. (In contrast, ReLU activations have been shown empirically to help because their non-differentiability causes vanishing gradients.) 
 
 
 
 Second, it introduces a novel method for estimating the ""regularity"" of the set of critical points -- i.e., those points whose Hessian matrix vanishes identically. Regularity measures whether nearby points tend to share similar properties like being locally optimal or having large negative eigenvalues. It turns out that if you know something about the regularity of one point, it's easy to compute estimates for other points based only on information contained within small neighborhoods around them. Thus, knowing just a few samples' regularities gives us useful information about many others without requiring expensive computations per sample! 
 
 Third, it studies the effect of batch normalization layers on the shape of the loss surfaces. Batch norm was introduced primarily so that deeper networks could learn faster while still maintaining good generalization performance. However, recent works suggest that batch-normed networks may suffer from poor convergence rates when trained via SGD due to flat regions in parameter space caused by zero-mean Gaussian noise added during each update step. Here, the authors use their theory to explain exactly what's going on: They find that adding batchnorm tends to increase the number of isolated critical points..."	1
"  We introduce the notion of ""covering homology"" of a commutative ring spectrum
with respect to certain families of coverings of topological spaces. The
construction of covering homology is extracted from Bokstedt, Hsiang and
Madsen's topological cyclic homology. In fact covering homology with respect to
the family of orientation preserving isogenies of the circle is equal to
topological cyclic homology.
  Our basic tool for the analysis of covering homology is a cofibration
sequence involving homotopy orbits and a restriction map similar to the
restriction map used in Bokstedt, Hsiang and Madsen's construction of
topological cyclic homology.
  Covering homology with respect to families of isogenies of a torus is
constructed from iterated topological Hochschild homology. It receives a trace
map from iterated algebraic K-theory and the hope is that the rich structure,
and the calculability of covering homology will make covering homology useful
in the exploration of J. Rognes' ``red shift conjecture''.

"Say you have a bucket of water and a few friends who all want a glass of water. You charge your friends $0.10 per glass because one bucket is pretty easy to bring. At first everyone can take as much as they want because there's plenty in the bucket. As more and more people show up who want water you have to go buy another bucket to start bringing more water. Soon you have more people who want a glass than you can carry in two buckets.


At this point you can't carry more water. You only have two hands. You can hire someone to help carry water, but that costs money and eats into your nice water profits. 


So you start charging people $0.15 a glass. As the price goes up people get a little angry about how much their spending on water, but they need the water. You start telling people how they can get by on a little less water. You up the cost to $0.20 saying that so many people want water that it's getting hard to get and we should all try to conserve water. People seem satisfied to start slowly buying less and less water to offset how much they're paying. At the same time more and more people are coming over to buy water.


So as a savy business person, you've not had to hire anyone to help you carry water (transmission lines), nor bought any new buckets (power plants) by making twice as many people buy less water individually but at twice the price. So people feel they're doing good and saving money. Meanwhile you just doubled your profits and added nothing to your expenses."	0
"  If the cold dark matter consists of weakly interacting massive particles
(WIMPs), anticipated measurements of the WIMP properties at the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC) and the International Linear Collider (ILC) will provide an
unprecedented experimental probe of cosmology at temperatures of order 1 GeV.
It is worth emphasizing that the expected outcome of these tests may or may not
be consistent with the picture of standard cosmology. For example, in
kination-dominated quintessence models of dark energy, the dark matter relic
abundance can be significantly enhanced compared to that obtained from freeze
out in a radiation-dominated universe. Collider measurements then will
simultaneously probe both dark matter and dark energy. In this article, we
investigate the precision to which the LHC and ILC can determine the dark
matter and dark energy parameters under those circumstances. We use an
illustrative set of four benchmark points in minimal supergravity in analogy
with the four LCC benchmark points. The precision achievable together at the
LHC and ILC is sufficient to discover kination-dominated quintessence, under
the assumption that the WIMPs are the only dark matter component. The LHC and
ILC can thus play important roles as alternative probes of both dark matter and
dark energy.

GROWN-UP SUMMARY:

In the aftermath of the plague, the royalty wanted to demonstrate to the public that it was cutting costs.

In the 1600s, British monarchs declared a very early version of the suit as the official dress of the court. It was halfway between what fancy people wore at the time and what commoners wore at the time. It was an attempt to make them seem down-to-earth.

This new attire was too tight for military use, so they made it progressively looser for riding and shooting. They also added a neckerchief, like modern soldiers, to keep out dirt and wear over their mouth and nose. 

The military version influenced the civilian version, making it looser but still form-fitting. For instance, the neckerchief became the neck tie, and the soldier's coat became the blazer.

ELI5 SUMMARY: 

There was once a terrible sickness. Everyone got sick and died. The Kings and Queens wanted the people of the land to know they cared, so they stopped wearing fancy clothes and instead made their old clothes look like the clothes of the commoners. The soldiers had to change their clothes too, for the King and Queen, but still needed to be able to fight. So they made their new clothes look the same but not so tight, and they added a neckerchief to keep the dirt out. The Kings and Queens liked the soldier's clothes so much, they made fancy versions like theirs. After doing this back and forth for hundreds of years, the ""fancy"" version of commoners' clothes now looks like a business suit."	0
"Sexto Sentido () is the fourteenth studio album and the tenth in Portuguese by Brazilian pop singer Xuxa. Was released on August 20, 1994 by the record company Som Livre.

Aimed at the children's audience, it was the first record of the presenter to win a title of their own, without depending on the programs presented by Xuxa as happened with the previous albums. Sexto Sentindo sold more than 1 million copies, gaining diamond certification by Associação Brasileira de Produtores de Discos (ABPD).

Production and songs
After a period full of international projects that were interrupted by a column problem, Xuxa began the year of 1994 decided that it would return to invest in the Brazilian public. The new program in Rede Globo gradually shaped itself and soon after, a new album began to be developed as well.

Xuxa's audience had been growing. Many of the children who accompanied her in the days of the Xou da Xuxa were already entering their adolescence and thus the need arose to produce a disc that could please all the age groups. In this way, Xuxa would continue conquering the children's public, but without leaving aside the public that consecrated it like Queen. The album features lyrics and more mature arrangements than previous releases. We have as an example the song ""Hey DJ"" in which the blonde bet on the funk from Rio that gained evidence in that period, already in 	""Dança Nas Estrelas"" the romantic pop and ""Happy-py"" the bet on reggae sharing the vocals with Carlinhos Brown.

According to the controversial book Sonho de Paquitas (Dream of Paquitas), released in 1995, Popcorn was recorded for a play that Xuxa would do that year. The idea of recording the song came by chance. In an interview at the time, the blonde told that it was during a chat in her house with her businesswoman of the time, Marlene Mattos and composers Álvaro Socci and Cláudio Matta, until she commented on the desire that was to eat popcorn and soon then returned from the kitchen with several pots full of popcorn. Half-embarrassed, the composers said they had written a song that talked about candy. Xuxa was curious, they showed the song and she decided to record.

Sexto Sentido was the first record to win a title that was not the same as a Xuxa program and the first to be developed without the intention of using the tracks as a soundtrack on TV. The explanation of the title is due to a curious fact. When the hostess recorded the song ""Sexto Sentido"", a fan told that she had dreamed she'd put that title on the album and found it interesting. It is worth remembering that throughout the process of selection of repertoire, Xuxa and his team choose the songs through intuition, another reason that made this name for the album.

Sexto Sentido was produced by Michael Sullivan, had Artistic Direction by Aramis Barros and Artistic coordination by Marlene Mattos and Xuxa, recorded at the Som Livre studios.

Release and reception
Sexto Sentido was released on August 20, 1994 in CD, cassette and LP formats, The album was also re-released on CD in 1996, 2001 and 2006. Becoming a sales success, remaining 18 weeks among the TOP 10. In was awarded diamond certification by Associação Brasileira de Produtores de Discos (ABPD) for selling 1,000,000 units.

Promotion
The release of the Sexto Sentido began with the debut of the Xuxa Park program in June 1994. The re-recording of ""É de Chocolate"" began to serve as the opening theme of the attraction and performed in the last block and ""Só Falta Você"" was performed shortly after the messages of Good Morning. Cry of War that was specially composed for the program, was the unique song to be sung in all the seasons of the Xuxa Park. In addition to the performances, were music videos of the songs ""Pipoca"", ""Hey DJ"", ""Sexto Sentido"", ""Dança da Bananeira"", 	""Rir é o Melhor Remédio (Gargalhada)"" and ""Muito Prazer, Eu Existo"". Initially, all tracks on the disc would win music videos.

The second stage of disclosure begins on August 21, 1994, when Xuxa presents the album in the program Domingão do Faustão. 2 days later a show was performed at the Imperator house in Rio de Janeiro to present the album.

In September, Xuxa gave interviews to the main Brazilian radio stations and shortly thereafter performed a mini-tour in nightclubs in São Paulo to promote the album. On October 7, 1994, the Sexto Sentido tour finally kicks off at the Olympia concert hall in São Paulo. The tour lasted until June 1996.

" Try to stay within this estimated budget. Then, once you’ve spent a semester or two actually homeschooling your child, revisit your original budget estimates and figure out how much you’ll actually need to spend on classes and materials, and how much money you can earn while still effectively educating your child at home. Use the actual data on your costs and earnings over the course of your first semester or two to allocate future money for classroom materials, textbooks, and so on.


Books, pencils, and other school materials can add up quickly. Deciding on your maximum expenditure will help you manage these costs and buy cautiously when building your child’s curriculum.
Don’t feel locked in to your budget. You should use it as a guide, but don’t worry if you go slightly over the budget.
You might find your budget varies from year to year.
Free or discounted materials for younger children tend to be easier to obtain than those for older children.
Reevaluate your budget at the beginning of each school year to ensure your budget is realistic relative to your child’s needs and your finances.;
, For instance, if your child and another are close in age and learning ability, you could teach them one subject, while the other parent could teach them another subject. That way, each of you will only need to invest in one set of learning materials, but your kids will have access to two different classes.


Work together with the other parent to develop a curriculum in each class that you’re both happy with.
This approach will also save you time, since you won’t have to prepare for the class that the other parent is teaching.
Sharing classes can help you cut down on your budget.

, Alternately, you could just (at discounted rates) buy secondhand materials from other members.


For instance, if your child is in the third grade, they will not need materials from their second-grade curriculum. Try to find a parent who is looking for materials for their second-grader and sell them to that parent.
Then, locate a parent in the network whose child is a bit older and no longer has use for third-grade materials. Obtain these materials through purchase or trade.
By obtaining all or many of the materials necessary for a certain grade level at once, you can save time.
You can often get flashcards, books, DVDs, and learning software for free or at discounted rates from parents who no longer have use for them.
Sharing class materials will help you keep your educational costs low.

, All you need is a marker and some notecards. Write the appropriate information on each side and you’ll have your very own set of educational flashcards. This will help you slash your budget for learning materials.


For instance, if you’re making flashcards for a German course, write English words on one side of the card and the German translation for each word on the opposite side. Your child can use these to study.

, Junk mail is often a prime candidate for reuse in a homeschool setting. Reusing paper is not only thrifty, but eco-friendly as well.


If possible, get unused paper with printing on just one side from friends and neighbors, too.

, These sales often offer steep discounts on notebooks, pencils, pens, and other school materials. Look for coupons that can help you score even bigger discounts at the checkout line. Getting materials on sale will help you figure out how much money your materials budget really needs.


If you’re really patient, you can sometimes get even better deals once the school year has gotten underway. Stores will try to liquidate their surpluses by offering their school supplies at discount rates.
Check dollar stores, office supply stores, and pharmacies for discounts on these materials.
Getting school materials on sale is an easy way to cut back on your overall budget.

, Homeschooling often means that one parent sacrifices their career in order to homeschool their child. However, if you are that parent, you don’t necessarily need to be entirely unemployed. If you can get a job where you can work from home, you’ll still be able to provide instruction to your child and make yourself available to them if they have questions. Good employment options for a parent who homeschools include:


graphic designer
writer
artist
musician

, Many parents choose to send their kids to public schools to participate in classes with expensive materials, or classes that are best learned through interaction with other students. For instance, you might choose to send your child to public school to take, art, drama, and debate classes. Sending your child to public school for certain classes can help you cut down on your overall budget.

"Al-Malik al-Mansur Izz ad-Din Abu Sa'id Farrukhshah Dawud was the Ayyubid Emir of Baalbek between 1179 and 1182 and Na'ib (Viceroy) of Damascus. He was the son of Saladin’s younger brother Nur ad-Din Shahanshah and the older brother of Taqi ad-Din Umar who became Emir of Hama.

In 1178 Saladin decided that the administration of his brother Shams ad-Din Turan-Shah in Damascus was too lax, and its relations with the Zengid rulers of Aleppo rather too friendly. He therefore moved Turan-Shah and selected his nephew Farrukh Shah as his successor. Farrukhshah had already proved himself to be a good soldier and he appears to have met Saladin’s expectations as an administrator, as he remained viceroy of Damascus until his death in October 1182 (Jumada 1 578).

Turan-Shah was compensated for his loss of Damascus with the domain of Baalbek, but he did not hold it for long.  In May 1179 (Dhu’l Qa’da 574) Saladin moved him again and made him governor of Alexandria.  For a second time, Farrukhshah was the beneficiary of Turan-Shah’s removal and Saladin gave him Baalbek.  Much of his reign was occupied in supporting Saladin’s wars against the Crusaders.  Shortly after his appointment to Baalbek, Farrukh Shah won a victory near the fortress of Belfort against Baldwin IV of Jerusalem, killing Humphrey II of Toron.

Farrukh Shah died in September 1182 (Jumada I 578) leaving a young boy, al-Amjad Bahramshah, as his successor.

"From an evolutionary view it is beneficial for us to easily remember bad memories. This helps us avoid repeating mistakes we have witnessed and keep us out of dangers way e.g. My friend was eaten by a bear in that cave, I remember this in great detail and avoid that cave in future so I'm less likely to be eaten by a bear.

I think it might be similar for things we find embarrassing. It's dangerous to do things that alienate you from a group since we are social creatures that rely on acceptance and group work to survive. If we remember things we've done before that threatened our social standing then we aren't likely to repeat the behaviour in future and avoid exclusion. That's just speculation though. 

Edit: for people asking for more info on this I highly recommend looking up evolutionary psychology.

'Evolutionary theories of emotion view emotions as adaptive traits - they help the organism to adapt to the demand of the environment and thereby survive' (Izard, 1977; Plutchik, 1984).

We present the results of our study on the electronic structure and magnetic properties of La0.7Sr1.3MnO3 using density functional theory (DFT) calculations within the local spin-density approximation (LSDA). We find that LSDA underestimates the band gap by about 0.5 eV, which is corrected to 1.2 eV when we use the self-interaction correction scheme proposed by Perdew et al.. Our calculated value agrees well with experimental data obtained from optical measurements. In addition, we have studied the effect of electron correlation on the ground state energy as a function of Ueff = U - J where U and J are respectively Coulomb repulsion and exchange parameters between two localized spins. It has been found that the total energy decreases monotonically upto Ueff ~ 3 eV beyond which it increases rapidly indicating strong electron correlations among Mn3+ ions. Finally, we show that the inclusion of spin-orbit coupling leads to an increase in the band gap by about 30%.	1
"The author of this article is an expert on identity and deep learning, which makes it interesting to read his views about how these two fields are related.  The main idea that he presents here is that there should be more research into what kind of identities we can build with machine-learning algorithms (e.g., neural networks).  He also discusses some possible applications where such identities could play important roles.
I think it's very useful to have someone who has both academic backgrounds present their ideas like this because they provide us readers with new insights from different perspectives.   I would recommend reading this article if you want to learn something about how artificial intelligence works or just enjoy thinking deeply about human behavior!

The paper performs domain adaptation using a very simple trick inspired by BatchNorm. The paper received below margin scores. The reviewers both, liked the simplicity of the approach, and at the same time felt that the contribution was too thin. Given the high bar of ICLR, this paper falls short.	0
We report on kinetic-ion simulations addressing whether ion trapping inflates stimulated Brillouin backscattering (SBS) reflectivities in the presence of an electron beam and plasma waves. We find that, for typical parameters relevant to high-power laser-plasma experiments, SBS is dominated by electrostatic Langmuir wave instabilities rather than ion-acoustic modes. The latter are suppressed due to Landau damping as well as mode conversion into electromagnetic radiation at oblique angles with respect to the direction of propagation. In addition, we show that the effect of ion trapping can be neglected if the density fluctuations associated with the trapped ions are small compared to those caused by the electrons. Finally, we demonstrate that the inclusion of ion trapping does not significantly affect the growth rates or saturation levels of the dominant electrostatic Langmuir waves. This finding suggests that the observed discrepancies between theory predictions and experimental results may originate from other effects such as nonlocality and/or nonlinear coupling among different types of waves.	1
It had high crime rates, gang violence, drugs etc.. because of poverty and unemployment. It also got worse after the crack cocaine epidemic hit NYC during this time period. The city became more violent as people were desperate to make money off selling drugs or committing crimes like robbery just to survive. There are many reasons why there is still some danger today but not nearly what it used to be back then. Crime has been reduced significantly since those days due to better policing methods and technology being developed by law enforcement agencies such as body cameras which record everything officers do while on duty. Criminals have become smarter too with new ways they can commit their crimes without getting caught. Because of all these things it's much safer than ever before! High crime rate, gang violence, drug use - because of poverty & unemployment. Also worsened after crack cocaine epidemic hit NYC: People desperate to make money from selling drugs or committing crimes (like robberies)	1

"We study the nonlinear dynamics of infectious diseases transfer in a population, where individuals are divided into three classes: susceptible (S), infected (I) and recovered/removed (R). We consider two different models: SIR model and SEIR model. In both cases we assume that there is no birth or death in the population. The main goal of this work is to investigate how the disease spreads through the population depending on its parameters. For example, if the infection rate is too high then it may lead to an epidemic outbreak. On the other hand, if the recovery rate is very large compared to the infection rate then the number of infectives will decrease rapidly. Finally, we show some numerical simulations which illustrate our results. 
 
 Keywords: Nonlinear dynamics, infectious diseases, tuberculosis, SIR model, SEIR model. 1 Introduction 
 
 Many mathematical models have been developed over time to describe the spread of infectious diseases within populations [1–3] . These models can be used as tools to understand the transmission mechanisms of these diseases and help public health authorities make decisions about prevention strategies [4] .
 
In particular, many researchers have studied the effects of vaccination programs [5–7] , quarantine [8, 9] and isolation [10, 11] on the evolution of epidemics. Other studies focus on the impact of environmental factors such as temperature [12, 13] , humidity [14, 15] and rainfall [16] on the propagation of pathogens. 
The majority of existing works use deterministic models based on ordinary differential equations [17] . However, stochastic models [18, 19] and agent-based models [20, 21] also exist. Agent-based models allow us to take into account individual behaviors [22] while stochastic models provide more realistic descriptions of random events [23] . 
 
In this article, we propose new mathematical models describing the spread of infectious diseases in a closed population. Our aim is to analyze the influence of various parameters on the behavior of the system. More specifically, we want to determine whether the disease will die out naturally or cause an epidemic outbreak. To do so, we first introduce the basic reproduction number R0 [24] , which represents the average number"	1
"Amal Tamimi (born Jerusalem, 7 January 1960) is a feminist, social activist, and politician. She was the second foreign-born person (after Paul Fontaine Nikolov) and the first foreign-born woman to sit in the Icelandic parliament (a substitute for Lúðvík Geirsson in 2011 and for Katrín Júlíusdóttir in 2012).

Life in Jordan occupied Israel, 1960–95
Amal was born in 1960, growing up in Wadi-el-Joz in east Jerusalem. Her father was Salim Abu Khaled al Tamimi (d. 1969), a businessman and passionate activist, and her mother Salim's second wife Nazima abu Rajabb al Tamimi (d. 1981); her siblings are Yonnes (b. 1950), Rowda (b. 1948), Safah (b. 1949), Amneh, and Salmann (b. 1955). Yonnes moved to Iceland in 1966, Amneh some years later, and Salmann in 1971.

Amal experienced the Six-Day War in 1967; the fact that Yonnes was in Iceland at the time meant that he lost his right to reside in Israel. She was politically active through most of her time in Israel. At 13 she was imprisoned pending trial for two weeks for throwing stones at Israeli soldiers, and received a six-month suspended sentence. She married for the first time at 16, and had the children Falastine (b. 1978), Fida (b. 1980), Wala (b. 1985), Majd (b. 1986), and Ahd (b. 1990), before leaving her husband after what she has described as an abusive marriage in 1995 and fleeing with her children to her brother Salmann (Suleiman) in Iceland. Later Amal said that she felt she had no rights as a woman under Shari'a Law.

In 1987, she gained a diploma in business studies via the YWCA and worked for an NGO.

Life in Iceland, 1995–
Amal first lived in Iceland in 1983–84 while separated from her husband, working for Nói Síríus.

Assisted by her brother Salmann (Suleiman), Amal moved with her five children to Iceland in January 1995. There she worked as a cleaner; then in a bakery and in fish processing, and learned Icelandic. Soon she met her second partner, Heiðar, with whom she had Bissan Inga in 1997; Amal and Heiðar parted in 2000. Amal's partnership with a non-Arab man caused a major rift in her family, including with her brother Salmann (Suleiman), who disowned her.

In 2001, at the age of 41, Amal went to the University of Iceland, taking a BA in Social Sciences in 2004, with a BA thesis entitled 'Terrorism in Palestine: Religion or Colonial Imperialism?' In 2002, she received Icelandic citizenship (for which she had to give up Palestinain citizenship) and on 24 October 2003 founded W.O.M.E.N. (Women of Multicultural Ethnicity Network). From 2004, she was a counsellor at the Alþjóðahús. In 2008, she became the first immigrant to chair Iceland's immigration council, founded the Jafnréttishús (Equality Centre) and became the first immigrant elected to Hafnarfjörður town council, while her daughter Falasteen Abu Libdeh became the first immigrant elected to Reykjavík City Council.

We present new optical integral field spectroscopy data for the galaxy cluster Abell 3627 (z=0.25) obtained with SINFONI at VLT/UT4. We detect an extended emission line region around one member galaxy, ESO 137-001, which is associated to star formation activity. The total extent of this region is about 1 Mpc along the line-of-sight. This galaxy shows evidence for recent interaction/merger events as well as ongoing nuclear starbursts. In addition we find several other galaxies showing signs of on-going or past interactions within the central part of the cluster. These results are discussed in terms of the effects of environment on galaxy evolution. Keywords: Galaxy clusters; Star formation rate; Environment; Integral Field Spectroscopy.

Because of government regulations and fees associated with adoption agencies, as well as other costs that are not covered by insurance companies or social services programs like Medicaid. The average fee is $25000 in the US alone. This includes agency fees ($5000), home study fees($2500-$3000) legal fees ($10000-$30000). Other countries have similar costs but may be slightly less expensive than the United States due to lower living standards.  Some states also require prospective parents to attend classes before they can apply which adds another expense. Because there aren't enough foster homes available many times these expenses must be paid outright instead of being reimbursed later on through state funds. Government regulation and fees associated with adoption agents, as well as other uncovered costs such as medical care. In addition some states will charge you if your child has special needs even though this should be handled under Medicaid	1
"Paul Billerbeck (4 April 1853 – 23 December 1932) was a Lutheran minister and scholar of Judaism, best known for his Commentary on the New Testament from the Talmud and Midrash (German, 1926) co-written with Hermann Strack. 

Billerbeck was born in Bad Schönfließ, Neumark, Prussia and educated in Greifswald and Leipzig. Billerbeck's participation in Strack's Commentary on the New Testament from the Talmud and Midrash commenced in 1906 when Strack encouraged Billerbeck to compile and expand the material of John Lightfoot, Christian Schoettgen (1733) and Johann Jacob Wetstein for a new German commentary on the New Testament using rabbinical literature.

"The authors present an interesting approach to sequence decomposition, which is useful in many applications such as text mining and bioinformatics.  The main idea of their method is that they use latent variable models (e.g., LDA) to decompose sequences into topics or concepts.
They show how this can be used on several real-world datasets including news articles from Reuters News Service,  Wikipedia pages about US presidents, and Twitter messages related to Hurricane Sandy. 
I think it would have been helpful if there were more examples showing what kinds of results are obtained by applying these methods. 

Overall I find the work very promising but some additional experiments could help readers better understand the proposed techniques. For example,

How does one choose the number of topics? How do you know when your topic model has converged?

What kind of information loss occurs during the transformation between original data points and inferred topics? 

In addition, please provide references where we may learn more details about the algorithms presented here"	1
"This trick was created by David Copperfield.  It has been performed numerous times around the world.   The method used here involves three packets (A,B &C) which contain different amounts of cards each.    You can perform this trick using any number between 1-26 as well but we have chosen 13 because it’s easy to remember and also happens to be my lucky number!   This version uses the same principle as the original except there aren’t actually 27 cards involved – just like the real deal!  To begin I would ask if anyone wants their fortune told or perhaps they’d prefer me... 
The first packet contains 12 cards - 11 regular ones plus the 13th key card!
Ask someone who knows how many cards are in the pack whether he thinks it's odd or even.  If he's not too bright then he'll probably say ""even""  Now turn over the bottom card and show him/her that there's another card hidden under it.... 
 
 Next you'll need some practice performing the actual trick before trying out the full effect.  Start off by asking what colour his/her favourite car is.  Then tell her/him/it that you're going to find its colour inside the pack.  Take the whole pack into your hands and hold it flat against the table while looking at both ends simultaneously.  Look carefully along the edge where the back meets the front of the pack.  You'll see tiny indentations made when the cards were pressed together during manufacturing.  These indentations form patterns known as ""fingerprints"".  Your job now is to look closely enough to spot these fingerprints and match them up correctly with those found on the backs of the cards themselves.  For example,..."	1
"The imperial ban () was a form of outlawry in the Holy Roman Empire. At different times, it could be declared by the Holy Roman Emperor, by the Imperial Diet, or by courts like the League of the Holy Court (Vehmgericht) or the Reichskammergericht.

People under imperial ban, known as Geächtete (from about the 17th century, colloquially also as Vogelfreie, lit. ""free as a bird""), lost all their rights and possessions. They were legally considered dead, and anyone was allowed to rob, injure or kill them without legal consequences. The imperial ban automatically followed the excommunication of a person, as well as extending to anyone offering help to a person under the imperial ban.

Those banned could reverse the ban by submitting to the legal authority. The Aberacht, a stronger version of the imperial ban, could not be reversed.

The imperial ban was sometimes imposed on whole Imperial Estates. In that case, other estates could attack and seek to conquer them. The effect of the ban on a city or other Estate was that it lost its Imperial immediacy and in the future would have a second overlord in addition to the emperor.

Famous people placed under the imperial ban included:

 1180 Henry the Lion, for refusing military support to Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor against the cities of the Lombard League.
 1225 Count Frederick of Isenberg, for killing his uncle Engelbert II of Berg, Archbishop of Cologne.
 1235 King Henry (VII) of Germany, for his rebellion against his father the Emperor Frederick II.
 1276 King Ottokar II of Bohemia, for his capture of imperial lands from Rudolph I.
 1309 John Parricida, for the murder of his uncle King Albert I of Germany.
 1415 Frederick IV, Duke of Austria for aiding the flight of Antipope John XXIII from the Council of Constance.
 1512 and 1518 Götz von Berlichingen, the first time for robbery, the second for kidnapping.
 1521 Martin Luther and his supporters, for claiming that some doctrines practiced by the Catholic Church were contrary to the Bible or had no biblical basis.
 1546 John Frederick I, Elector of Saxony and Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse, for leading the Schmalkaldic League.
 1566 Wilhelm von Grumbach, for insurgency.
 1621 Frederick V, Elector Palatine, and his supporters Prince Christian I of Anhalt-Bernburg and Georg Friedrich of Hohenlohe-Neuenstein-Weikersheim, for seizing power in Bohemia.
 1706 Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria, and Joseph Clemens, Elector of Cologne, for supporting France in the War of the Spanish Succession (ban reversed in 1714)
 1793 Georg Forster, for collaboration with the French Republic.

The imperial ban imposed by the Emperor Rudolf II on the city of Donauwörth after an anti-Catholic riot was one of the incidents leading to the Thirty Years' War.

An imperial ban on Bremen preceded the 1654 Swedish attack on Bremen.

"The Goldman child abduction case refers to the 2004–2009 international child abduction of Sean Goldman and the international petition for his repatriation by his father, David Goldman, over the objections of his mother, Bruna Bianchi Carneiro Ribeiro (died 2008), her family, and her new husband (married 2007), João Paulo Lins e Silva.

The child abduction case
The child abduction case evolved around application of Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. Sean Richard Bianchi Carneiro Ribeiro Goldman was born in the year 2000 in the United States, to an American father and Brazilian mother. In 2004, at the age of four years, Sean went to Brazil with his mother for a 2-week vacation. However, his mother refused to return to the United States. The father David Goldman vowed to have his son back and lawsuits and counter-lawsuits ensued both in the United States and in Brazil.

Bruna Bianchi eventually filed for, and was granted, a divorce by a Brazilian court. She then married Brazilian lawyer João Paulo Lins e Silva in 2007, and subsequently died while giving birth to their child in 2008. After Bruna's death, the Brazilian husband obtained a custody order for the child from the Brazilian courts by failing to inform them of Bruna's death and requesting a new Brazilian birth certificate be issued that listed himself as the father under the Brazilian concept of socio-affective paternity, on the basis of which, he refused to return the boy to David Goldman, Sean's father. Based on a decision of Brazil's Supreme Court, Sean was handed over to his father on December 24, 2009. As of January, 2010, his Brazilian family was hoping to regain custody. Sean's grandmother Silvana Bianchi Carneiro Ribeiro has vowed to continue the battle through the Brazilian courts. 
New Jersey courts have denied visitation rights for both grandparents months before the grandfather's death.

International ramifications
The case was focus of international media coverage. It was also subject of deliberations during meetings of high level Brazilian and American officials. US Congress introduced H.R. 2702, legislation to suspend Brazil's Generalized System of Preferences trading benefit. The case was also discussed on the US House of Representatives floor with a statement from Congressman Chris Smith (Republican, New Jersey), a staunch supporter of David Goldman, a New Jersey resident; U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton treated the case as a diplomatic issue of Brazil's obligations under the Hague Convention.

Media coverage
On 30 January 2009, NBC's news program Dateline NBC broadcast a lengthy piece titled ""Fighting for Sean"" on the case and an interview by program's Meredith Vieira with David Goldman, the child's father.
The Dateline piece caught the attention of Congressman Chris Smith (R-New Jersey) who contacted the father and offered help. He wrote a major article in The Washington Times on 19 June 2009 titled ""Will Brazil Do The Right Thing"". 
Goldman was interviewed on many media outlets including in Today a few times, on Dr Phil show on 1 December 2008, on CNN's Larry King Live on 4 March 2009, on CTV's Canada AM and on Fox News Channel's On the Record
There were public comments on the case by US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on 4 March 2009 on NBC's Today show and by Brazilian President Lula on CNN on 23 March 2009.    
On 15 July 2009, David Goldman testified in front of a Congress committee about child abductions. On 16 July 2009, NBC's Today broadcast a one-hour interview with him.
NBC paid for a charter flight for David Goldman and 9-year-old Sean back to the U.S. NBC News correspondent Jeff Rossen, along with other members of his team, was on board the plane. The Society of Professional Journalists condemned NBC News for practicing ""checkbook journalism"" by chartering the jet. Mr. Goldman stated in his book, A Father's Love, that NBC had already chartered the jet to fly its news crew home in time for Christmas Day, and when the courts granted him custody on December 24, NBC offered the ride so that he wouldn't have to risk taking a public flight.
On 8 January 2010, Dateline NBC broadcast a special on the case upon the successful return of the child to his father. The 2-hour special presented by Meredith Vieira was titled ""Bringing Sean Home: The Untold Story"". Parts of the exclusive interview and shots of the father-son reunion were broadcast on NBC's Today on 28 December 2009. Parts of this special were aired in Brazil by Rede Record newsmagazine series Domingo Espetacular presented by Paulo Henrique Amorim, on 17 January 2010.
 The season 20 episode of Law & Order titled ""Brazil"" was inspired by the custody case.
 On April 27, 2012 Dateline aired an exclusive interview with Sean Goldman that was conducted by Meredith Vieira.

"It has to do with what the purpose of a Constitution is and what questions it was created to answer.  In many countries, especially in Europe, the question was ""We have a country, how do we govern it?""  That is, the existence of the country is taken as a given and the constitution simply describes how the government should be organized.  In countries like these, when there's enough unrest that they decide to adopt a new constitution, those in power get to stay in power (mostly) and the government can hobble along until it can regroup.

The United States is different.  When the 13 (former) colonies wrote the US constitution, the question was ""We need to create a country, what form should it take?""  The United States of America DID NOT EXIST as a nation until the constitution was ratified and crated it.  In a sense, you could say that the constitution IS the United States of America.  The US constitution can be changed via the amendment process, but if the USA ever decided to throw it out whole cloth, the federal government would immediately lose all power.  The President, Congress, the Supreme Court, and all of the supporting institutions would lose all legal power they had and all government responsibilities would revert to the States until (and if) a new constitution could be ratified.

The reason that the US constitution is treated as sacred text is because in a sense it is.  The government is not allowed to pass any laws that contradict it (and it's the Supreme Court's job to enforce this), and if they ever tried to throw it out they would all immediately be out of a job.  It's the legal backbone that holds up the entire federal government."	0
"1. No known species of reindeer can fly. But there are 300,000 species of living organisms yet to be classified, and while most of these are insects and germs, this does not completely rule out flying reindeer, which only Santa has seen.



2. There are 2 billion children (under 18) in the world. But since Santa doesn't appear to handle Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, and Jewish children, that reduces the workload to 15% of the total - 378 million or so. At an average rate of 3.5 children per household, that's 91.8 million homes. One presumes there's at least one good child in each. 



3. Santa has 31 hours of Christmas to work with thanks to time zones and the rotation of the earth, assuming he travels east to west. This works out to 822.6 visits per second. This is to say that for each Christian household with good children, Santa has 1/1000th of a second to park, hop out of the sleigh, jump down the chimney, fill the stockings, distribute the remaining gifts under the tree, eat the snacks, get back up the chimney, get back in the sleigh, and move on to the next house. Assuming that each of these 91.8 million homes are distributed evenly (which we know to be false but for the sake of these calculations we will accept) we are now talking about .78 miles per household, a total trip of 75 1/2 million miles, not counting bathroom stops. This means that Santa's sleigh is traveling at 650 miles per second, 3000 times the speed of sound. For comparison, the fastest man made vehicle, the Ulysses space probe moves at a poky 27.4 MPS; the average reindeer runs at 15 MPH.



4. The sleigh's payload adds another interesting element. Assuming that each child gets nothing more than a medium sized LEGO set (about 2 pounds), the sleigh is carrying 321,300 tons not counting Santa, who is inexorably described as overweight. On land, conventional reindeer can pull no more than 300 pounds. Even granting that 'flying reindeer' (see point one) could pull TEN TIMES the usual amount, we cannot do the job with 8 or even 9, we need 214,000 reindeer. This increases the weight, not even counting the sleigh, to 353,430 tons. Again for comparison this is 4 times the weight of the Queen Elizabeth 2.



5. 353,000 tons traveling at 650 miles per second creates enormous air resistance. This will heat the reindeer in the same manner as a spacecraft re-entering the earth's atmosphere. The lead pair of reindeer will absorb 14.2 QUINTILLION joules of energy. Per second. Each. In short, they will burst into flame almost instantaneously, exposing the next pair of reindeer, and creating deafening sonic booms in their wake. The entire team will be vaporized within 4.26 thousands of a second. Santa, meanwhile, will be subjected to centrifugal forces 17,500.06 times the force of gravity. A 300 pound Santa would be pinned to the back of his sleigh by 4,315,015 pounds of force.



6. Conclusion: If there was a Santa, he's dead now

"Forgive me for this is on mobile. 

The short answer is we don't know. The long answer is we have some interesting evidence that points towards a reason for the phenomenon but not a cause. I'm going to explain a study done at the University of Lethbridge that might shed some light on the subject. 

One of the professors there (I'm sorry I don't remember his name, I believe it was Dr. Matsumoto) did a study on this. 

Certain cells in the hippocampus activate when you (or a rat) enter and leave a certain place in the environment. These are called place cells. This professor basically hooked some electrodes (recording devices) up to some rats and recorded the neural activity from these kinds of cells when they were plodding around a circle. He then compared activations from when they were awake to when they are asleep. He found that that these cells activate sequentially in relation to where the rat is in the environment when they are awake. But here's the kicker, they activate at 3x the rate while the rat is asleep. 

So judging from this the rat was experiencing what they just had done IRL while asleep. But three times faster. 

Now like I said this doesn't fully answer your question but I hope it shines some light on what is happening. 

Tldr; Rat run in circle. Experiences time in a certain way.

Rat go sleep, same brain times but multiplied by three, seeming longer.

" By being surrounded by this information all the time, they will gradually begin to remember this information subconsciously, meaning that the facts will be second hand. This will make learning even more new information much easier., There are plastic ones available that will float in the bathtub, allowing that fun sense of learning to go beyond the class room and encourage them to think for themselves - encourage them to play with those.

, Remember, the concept of counting is more important than learning to identify shapes of numeric figures - that will be something that comes after counting has become normal in every day life. The recognition of numeric figures should come in natural, gradual way, through activities. Do not force the information too much, especially if the child is struggling with the information or finding it overwhelming. Allow them time to think and explain things in a clear, concise manner which is simple but not immensely detailed. Mastering the basics is your chief aim here before moving on to further elements.

, This should hopefully provide initiative for the child to demonstrate their counting skills whilst playing and without you necessarily needing to ask them.

, Oh, Hey! Another one; and guess what, that's a total of two!""

This will subtly remind them of what they have been learning, again encouraging them to think about it beyond the class room to incorporate it into every day life.

Tell them abstract concept of measurement, like taller than, shorter than, lower than, higher than, smaller than, larger than through these activities. If you feel they are beginning to become used to or accustomed to a word, begin to throw in new words to their vocabulary to make things more interesting and challenging.

2, 2 + 2 = 4, 4 + 2 = 6, 6 + 2 = 8, 8 + 2 = 10, two is in 10 5 times. So then say, ""2 multiplied by 5 is equal to 10,"" then also say ""5 times 2 equals 10""...


Repeatedly subtracting 2 is what dividing by two is based upon.

10 - 2 = 8, 8 - 2 = 6, 6 - 2 = 4, 4 - 2 = 2, 2-2 = 0, two is in 10 5 times. So then 10 divided by 2 is 5. Use multiplying to check division.
10 divided by 5 = 2

""Check"": 2 times 5 is 10.

,, Talk about 1/2 of a candy, half of a drink, etc.


Ask, ""Is this half?"" Explain that it's only half if it is split into 2 equal parts, numbers or amounts.
Ask, ""Can I have the big half?""; then ask ""Why that is a silly question?""

Explain that ""half"" really means splitting something into parts that are ""exactly the same"" and so either half should be equal: the same...



, So explain that 1 out of 2 possible or 2 out of 4 of the same kind of things is another way to say ""one half"", so 2 is half of 4 (of of the 4 items or half of the 4 minutes of ""time"").

"* Humans can eat all food types raw - there is nothing ""wrong"" with our digestive system. You can eat veggies, meat, and fish raw but it carries the risk of you contracting a [foodborne illness](_URL_0_) (e.g. bacteria, parasite, or fungal contamination of food). The issue isn't the raw-ness per se, but rather the increased risk of getting a foodborne illness.

* ALL foods carry the risk of contracting a foodborne illness if eaten raw. Same thing goes for untreated water, in which case you carry the risk of contracting a [waterborne illness](_URL_4_) like [giardia](_URL_1_).

* Modern food distribution and water treatment systems make it harder for these foodborne/waterborne illnesses to get to you. However, we still have foodborne illness outbreaks on raw food because our system is not 100% safe. For example, when recalls are made for *E. coli* or [salmonella outbreaks on tomatoes](_URL_2_), lettuces, etc. Always try to prepare your food before eating it, this can save your life or at the very least save you from a very unpleasant couple of days.

* Preparing food (e.g. cooking, boiling, washing, peeling, freezing, smoking) all help reduce the risk of contracting a foodborne illness. Cooking specifically also has the added benefit of being easier to digest and enables us to extract more calories from cooked food. A double win. 

* [Wild animals](_URL_3_) and domestic animals can also and often do contract foodborne and waterborne illnessess.

My point is animals are also susceptible to the same, and sometimes different, foodborne illness that we are.

* The only animals that have a much stronger (but not perfect) digestive system are carrion eaters like buzzards or vultures. They have very strong digestive systems that make it hard for foodborne illnesses to take hold."	0

"Bartholin glands produce lubricating fluids which help protect against infection.  If these glands become blocked by an obstruction—such as mucus build-up—the result can lead to swelling called a ""Bartholin cyst.""  While some women experience only mild symptoms associated...with their Bartholin cyst(s), others report severe pain when they urinate.   In addition,...many women feel embarrassed because this condition often causes visible bulges near the vagina.... This article provides information regarding how to treat a Bartholin cyst at home before seeking medical attention; however, it's important to know what tests need to take place so proper care can begin immediately afterwards:   Your physician should perform a physical exam including pelvic exams to check for lumps around the vulva and labia majora.    A laboratory test might also be performed to rule out other conditions like infections or tumors.     Ultrasound imaging could be used to confirm whether you're dealing with a Bartholin cyst rather than another type of mass."	1
"Alyssa Erin Beckerman (born January 23, 1981) is an American former gymnast and balance beam national champion. She was a member of the United States national team from 1997 to 2000, and competed on the University of California, Los Angeles intercollegiate gymnastics team from 2001 to 2003. She was an alternate for the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games.

Gymnastics career

Pre-elite 
Beckerman began training in gymnastics in 1986, when she was five years old.

Elite career 
In 1996, Beckerman placed twenty-fifth in the all-around junior division at the Coca-Cola National Championships. In 1997, Beckerman became a senior competitor and a member of the United States national team. She competed at the 1997 US Classic and placed ninth in the all-around. She also competed at the 1997 John Hancock US Gymnastics Championships, placing twentieth in the all-around.

In 1998, Beckerman moved from New Jersey to Ohio to train with coach Mary Lee Tracy at Cincinnati Gymnastics Academy. Tracy trained Beckerman for up to ten hours per day, and kept Beckerman on a restrictive diet of under 1100 calories per day. According to Beckerman, Tracy ""controlled every element, in and out of the gym"" creating a competitive culture of anxiety and silence.

Beckerman was a silver medalist on bars at the 1998 US National Championships and placed second in the all-around at the 1998 Ecoair Gymnastics Cup. Beckerman was third on bars and fourth in the all-around at the 1999 US National Championships. She was third in the all around at the 1999 American Classic and a team silver medalist at the 1999 Pan American Games. She took third in the all-around at the 1999 World Championships trials and was named to the 1999 US World Championships team but was unable to compete due to a broken wrist.  Beckerman won the all-around and team competition at the 2000 Spieth Sogipa. She was first on balance beam, second on bars and fifth in the all-around at the 2000 US National Championships. She was named an alternate member of the 2000 US Olympic team, but did not compete because fellow alternate Tasha Schwikert was selected instead to replace injured team member Morgan White.

By the end of Beckerman's elite career, she had suffered nine broken bones, undergone two surgeries, and developed bleeding ulcers from overuse of anti-inflammatory drugs. During her career, she also suffered from disordered eating. During her elite career, her favorite event was uneven bars.

Intercollegiate career 
Beckerman competed on the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) intercollegiate gymnastics team from 2001 to 2003 while pursuing a degree in sociology.  In 2001, Beckerman was limited to three competitions due to a wrist injury. She placed second and recorded a score of 9.875 on balance beam at Arizona State, as well as placing fifth on balance beam with a score of 9.8 at the UCLA Invitational. She earned NACGC Scholastic All-America honors that year. During the 2002 season, Beckerman was UCLA's anchor on balance beam, averaging 9.77 over the year and winning individually six times.  She was NCAA South Central Regional balance beam champion and Pac-10 balance beam champion, as well as earning a Pac-10 All-Academic honorable mention. On September 11, 2003, at the beginning of her senior year, Beckerman was dismissed from the UCLA team by coach Valorie Kondos Field. Kondos Field claimed that the dismissal was due to Beckerman's performance in training and unenthusiastic attitude, although Beckerman disputed those allegations. Beckerman was stripped of her athletic scholarship and housing, but completed her degree. In 2020, following widespread public discussion on social media under the hashtag ""#gymnastalliance"" of allegations by gymnasts of an abusive gymnastics culture that rewarded coaches who damaged and belittled gymnasts, Beckerman posted an open letter to Ms Kondos Field on social media where she related her experiences of competing at UCLA.

Post-gymnastics career 
As of 2018, Beckerman owns a music school and works as an emergency medical technician in New Jersey. In a 2018 interview after the USA gymnastics abuse scandal became public, Beckerman expressed that she was ""leaning toward"" favoring the dissolution of USA Gymnastics because ""the structure needs to be changed completely so obedience isn't the desired outcome."" She said:""When [a coach] has so much control, it puts a young person in a mindset that the coach has more authority than anyone else in their life - that they should put all their faith in them...There's a fine line between...where the culture is healthy, to a culture of silence...[In elite gymnastics, gymnasts] were not allowed to speak...That does a lot to you, psychologically. You try to be as meek and as serious as possible. 'Stoic' was this huge compliment at [national training] camp. We all strived for that. Being someone who never complained was a compliment. So, you don't speak out, because it's ingrained in you that if you do, you have poor integrity, that you're a bad gymnast, a bad teammate. Asking questions [in elite gymnastics] is very taboo.""

Personal life 
Beckerman was born in Long Branch, New Jersey to Howard and Melanie Beckerman. She has two brothers and is the middle sibling. Beckerman grew up in Middletown Township, New Jersey, where she attended Middletown High School South. In 2014, she married Matthew King.

"Because of economic inequality and poverty. The rich are getting richer, while poor people struggle to make ends meet. This has caused many Americans who were once considered ""middle-class"" to fall into poverty or become homeless. Many have been forced out by rising rents as well. Economic inequality also causes crime rates to rise because there isn't enough money available to provide jobs that pay decent wages so some people turn to theft instead. Because of this, police officers are being deployed more often than ever before which leads to even higher crime rates. Crime rates are at an all-time high across America today due to these factors. There aren't enough resources allocated towards education either causing schools to be overcrowded with students unable to get good educations. Some parents can't afford school supplies like books anymore forcing their children to go without them.

" Such physicians are known as haematologists.


Their routine work mainly includes the care and treatment of patients with haematological diseases, although some may also work at the haematology laboratory viewing blood films and bone marrow slides under the microscope, interpreting various haematological test results.
In some institutions, haematologists also manage the haematology laboratory.
Physicians who work in haematology laboratories, and most commonly manage them, are pathologists specialized in the diagnosis of haematological diseases, referred to as haematopathologists.
Haematologists and haematopathologists generally work in conjunction to formulate a diagnosis and deliver the most appropriate therapy if needed.;
, Haematologists may specialise further or have special interests, for example in:


bleeding disorders such as haemophilia and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura
haematological malignacies such as lymphoma and leukemia (onco haematology)
haemoglobinopathies
the science of blood transfusion and the work of a blood bank
bone marrow and stem cell transplantation

, Only some blood disorders can be cured.

, Haematological analysis involves the determination of different blood parameters, which can be done using either the electronic quantification or the manual quantification.


The electronic quantification can be done with the use of the auto counter and these displace about 15 parameters, while the manual quantification of PCV for example, is by the use of the Micro haematocrit centrifuge. This Micro haematocrit centrifuge is used to determine the Packed Cell Volume (PCV), from which many other parameters can be obtained.
The best way to determine blood parameters is through the electronic device called auto counter because it gives accurate values and manual red blood cell counting is obsolete and inaccurate Although, the manual quantification is also used to confirm whether the values obtained from the auto counter correlate with it for PCV.
The haematocrit (Ht or HCT) or packed cell volume (PCV) or erythrocyte volume fraction (EVF) is the proportion of blood volume that is occupied by red blood cells. It is normally about 46% for men and 38% for women. It is considered an integral part of a person's complete blood count results, along with hemoglobin concentration, white blood cell count, and platelet count.

, The term ""haematocrit"" was coined in 1903. Its roots stem from the Greek words hema- blood, and krites, judge - meaning to gauge or judge the blood.In mammals, haematocrit is independent of body size. The PCV of animals can also be determined, to know their anaemic state.


Elevated haematocrit - In cases of dengue fever a high haematocrit is a danger sign of an increased risk of dengue shock syndrome.

Polycythemia vera (PV), a myeloproliferative disorder in which the bone marrow produces excessive numbers of red cells, is associated with elevated haematocrit.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other pulmonary conditions associated with hypoxia may elicit an increased production of red blood cells. This increase is mediated by the increased levels of erythropoietin by the kidneys in response to hypoxia.
Professional athletes' haematocrit levels are measured as part of tests for blood doping or Erythropoietin (EPO) use; the level of haematocrit in a blood sample is compared with the long-term level for that athlete (to allow for individual variations in haematocrit level), and against an absolute permitted maximum (which is based on maximum expected levels within the population, and the haematocrit level which causes increased risk of blood clots resulting in strokes or heart attacks).
If a patient is dehydrated, the haematocrit may be elevated. Repeat testing after adequate hydration therapy will usually result in a more reliable result.


Lowered haematocrit - Lowered haematocrit can imply significant hemorrhage (for example, in an ectopic pregnancy).

The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and the red cell distribution width (RDW) can be quite helpful in evaluating a lower-than-normal haematocrit, because it can help the clinician determine whether blood loss is chronic or acute. The MCV is the size of the red cells and the RDW is a relative measure of the variation in size of the red cell population. A low haematocrit with a low MCV with a normal RDW suggests a chronic iron-deficient erythropoiesis, but a high RDW suggests a blood loss that is more acute, such as a hemorrhage.



, They include:


Infants who may not have adequate iron intake
Children going through a rapid growth spurt, during which the iron available cannot keep up with the demands for a growing red cell mass
Women in childbearing years who have an excessive need for iron because of blood loss during menstruation
Pregnant women, in whom the growing fetus creates a high demand for iron.
Patients with chronic kidney disease, as their kidneys no longer secrete sufficient levels of the hormone erythropoietin, which stimulates red blood cell production by the bone marrow.

, This is the main oxygen transport protein in the fetus during the last seven months of development in the uterus and in the newborn until the neonate (newborn child) is roughly 6 months old. Functionally, fetal haemoglobin differs most from adult haemoglobin in that it is able to bind oxygen with greater affinity than the adult form, giving the developing fetus better access to oxygen from the mother's bloodstream.


In newborns, fetal hemoglobin is nearly completely replaced by adult haemoglobin by approximately the twelfth week of postnatal life. In adults, fetal haemoglobin production can be reactivated pharmacologically, which is useful in the treatment of such diseases as sickle-cell disease.
Foetal haemoglobin, (also hemoglobin F or HbF) is the main oxygen transport protein in the fetus during the last seven months of development in the uterus and in the newborn until the neonate (newborn child) is roughly 6 months old. Functionally, fetal haemoglobin differs most from adult haemoglobin in that it is able to bind oxygen with greater affinity than the adult form, giving the developing fetus better access to oxygen from the mother's bloodstream.
In newborns, fetal hemoglobin is nearly completely replaced by adult haemoglobin by approximately the twelfth week of postnatal life. In adults, fetal haemoglobin production can be reactivated pharmacologically, which is useful in the treatment of such diseases as sickle-cell disease.

, When fetal haemoglobin production is switched off after birth, normal children begin producing adult haemoglobin (HbA). Children with sickle-cell disease instead begin producing a defective form of haemoglobin called haemoglobin S. This variety of haemoglobin aggregates, forming filaments that cause red blood cells to change their shape from round to sickle-shaped, which have a greater tendency to stack on top of one another and crowd blood vessels. These invariably lead to so-called painful vaso-occlusive episodes, which are a hallmark of the disease.

If fetal haemoglobin remains the predominant form of haemoglobin after birth, however, the number of painful episodes decreases in patients with sickle-cell disease. Hydroxyurea promotes the production of fetal hemoglobin and can be used to treat individuals with sickle-cell disease. Combination therapy with hydroxyurea and recombinant erythropoietin—rather than treatment with hydroxyurea alone have been shown to further elevate haemoglobin F levels and to promote the development of HbF-containing F-cells.

, This refers to the process of determining the genotype of an individual by the use of electrophoresis. Current methods of doing this include PCR, DNA sequencing, ASO probes, and hybridization to DNA micro-arrays or beads. The technology is important in clinical research for the investigation of disease-associated genes.


Due to current technological limitations, almost all genotyping is partial. That is, only a small fraction of an individual’s genotype is determined. This experiment actually only determines the phenotype, not genotype.

, Experiments with blood transfusions, the transfer of blood or blood components into a person's blood stream, have been carried out for hundreds of years. Many patients have died and it was not until 1901, when the Austrian Karl Landsteiner discovered human blood groups, that blood transfusions became safer.


Mixing blood from two individuals can lead to blood clumping or agglutination. The clumped red cells can crack and cause toxic reactions. This can have fatal consequences. Karl Landsteiner discovered that blood clumping was an immunological reaction which occurs when the receiver of a blood transfusion has antibodies against the donor blood cells.
Karl Landsteiner's work made it possible to determine blood groups and thus paved the way for blood transfusions to be carried out safely. For this discovery he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1930.

, An adult human has about 4–6 liters (1.6 US gal) of blood circulating in the body. Among other things, blood transports oxygen to various parts of the body. Blood consists of several types of cells floating around in a fluid called plasma. The red blood cells contain hemoglobin, a protein that binds oxygen. Red blood cells transport oxygen to, and remove carbon dioxide from, the body tissues. The white blood cells fight infection. The platelets help the blood to clot, if you get a wound for example. The plasma contains salts and various kinds of proteins.

, The differences in human blood are due to the presence or absence of certain protein molecules called antigens and antibodies. The antigens are located on the surface of the red blood cells and the antibodies are in the blood plasma. Individuals have different types and combinations of these molecules. The blood group you belong to depends on what you have inherited from your parents.


There are more than 20 genetically determined blood group systems known today, but the AB0 and Rh systems are the most important ones used for blood transfusions. Not all blood groups are compatible with each other. Mixing incompatible blood groups leads to blood clumping or agglutination, which is dangerous for individuals. Nobel Laureate Karl Landsteiner was involved in the discovery of both the AB0 and Rh blood groups:

ABO blood grouping system - According to the AB0 blood group system there are four different kinds of blood groups: A, B, AB or 0 (null).
Blood group A - If you belong to the blood group A, you have A antigens on the surface of your red blood cells and B antibodies in your blood plasma.
Blood group B - If you belong to the blood group B, you have B antigens on the surface of your red blood cells and A antibodies in your blood plasma.
Blood group AB - If you belong to the blood group AB, you have both A and B antigens on the surface of your red blood cells and no A or B antibodies at all in your blood plasma.
Blood group 0 - If you belong to the blood group 0 (null), you have neither A or B antigens on the surface of your red blood cells but you have both A and B antibodies in your blood plasma.
Rh factor blood grouping system - Many people also have a so called Rh factor on the red blood cell's surface. This is also an antigen and those who have it are called Rh+. Those who haven't are called Rh-. A person with Rh- blood does not have Rh antibodies naturally in the blood plasma (as one can have A or B antibodies, for instance). But a person with Rh- blood can develop Rh antibodies in the blood plasma if he or she receives blood from a person with Rh+ blood, whose Rh antigens can trigger the production of Rh antibodies. A person with Rh+ blood can receive blood from a person with Rh- blood without any problems.



, According to above blood grouping systems, you can belong to either of following 8 blood groups:


A Rh+
B Rh+
AB Rh+
0 Rh+
A Rh-
B Rh-
AB Rh-
0 Rh-

, You mix the blood with three different reagents including either of the three different antibodies, A, B or Rh antibodies. Then you take a look at what has happened.


In which mixtures has agglutination occurred? The agglutination indicates that the blood has reacted with a certain antibody and therefore is not compatible with blood containing that kind of antibody.
If the blood does not agglutinate, it indicates that the blood does not have the antigens binding the special antibody in the reagent.
If you know which antigens are in the person's blood, it's easy to figure out which blood group he or she belongs to! Application:

A person with A+ blood receives B+ blood. The B antibodies (yellow) in the A+ blood attack the foreign red blood cells by binding to them. The B antibodies in the A+ blood bind the antigens in the B+ blood and agglutination occurs. This is dangerous because the agglutinated red blood cells break after a while and their contents leak out and become toxic.
A person with A+ blood receives B+ blood. The B antibodies (yellow) in the A+ blood attack the foreign red blood cells by binding to them. The B antibodies in the A+ blood bind the antigens in the B+ blood and agglutination occurs. This is dangerous because the agglutinated red blood cells break after a while and their contents leak out and become toxic.



, For a blood transfusion to be successful, AB0 and Rh blood groups must be compatible between the donor blood and the patient blood. If they are not, the red blood cells from the donated blood will clump or agglutinate. The agglutinated red cells can clog blood vessels and stop the circulation of the blood to various parts of the body. The agglutinated red blood cells also crack and its contents leak out in the body. The red blood cells contain hemoglobin which becomes toxic when outside the cell. This can have fatal consequences for the patient.


The A antigen and the A antibodies can bind to each other in the same way that the B antigens can bind to the B antibodies. This is what would happen if, for instance, a B blood person receives blood from an A blood person. The red blood cells will be linked together, like bunches of grapes, by the antibodies. As mentioned earlier, this clumping could lead to death.

, Of course, you can always give A blood to persons with blood group A, B blood to a person with blood group B and so on. But in some cases you can receive blood with another type of blood group, or donate blood to a person with another kind of blood group.


The transfusion will work if a person who is going to receive blood has a blood group that doesn't have any antibodies against the donor blood's antigens. But if a person who is going to receive blood has antibodies matching the donor blood's antigens, the red blood cells in the donated blood will clump.

, This is the localization of antigens or proteins in tissue sections by the use of labeled antibodies as specific reagents through antigen-antibody interactions that are visualized by a marker such as fluorescent dye, enzyme, or colloidal gold. There are numerous immunohistochemistry methods that may be used to localize antigens. The selection of a suitable method should be based on parameters such as the type of specimen under investigation and the degree of sensitivity required.

, Cancer occurs as a result of mutations, or abnormal changes, in the genes responsible for regulating the growth of cells and keeping them healthy. The genes are in each cell’s nucleus, which acts as the “control room” of each cell. Normally, the cells in our bodies replace themselves through an orderly process of cell growth: healthy new cells take over as old ones die out. But over time, mutations can “turn on” certain genes and “turn off” others in a cell. That changed cell gains the ability to keep dividing without control or order, producing more cells just like it and forming a tumor.


A tumor can be benign (not dangerous to health) or malignant (has the potential to be dangerous). Benign tumors are not considered cancerous: their cells are close to normal in appearance, they grow slowly, and they do not invade nearby tissues or spread to other parts of the body. Malignant tumors are cancerous. Left unchecked, malignant cells eventually can spread beyond the original tumor to other parts of the body.
During the immunohistochemical staining of a tissue, antigens are usually expressed if the tissue stains positive. These antigens can either be breast cancer antigens or non-breast cancer antigens

, Breast cancer is an uncontrolled growth of breast cells. To better understand breast cancer, it helps to understand how any cancer can develop. The term “breast cancer” refers to a malignant tumor that has developed from cells in the breast. Usually breast cancer either begins in the cells of the lobules, which are the milk-producing glands, or the ducts, the passages that drain milk from the lobules to the nipple. Less commonly, breast cancer can begin in the stromal tissues, which include the fatty and fibrous connective tissues of the breast.

Karate is a term that today means 'empty hand,' but when it was first introduced to Japan, it meant 'foreign hand,' as it came from Okinawa, and before that, it can be traced back to China, with much of it coming from the shaolin temple.  As such, many techniques in Okinawan Karatejutsu have similarities to Shaolin styles.  Karate today is taught in different styles, but it basically revolves around striking, grappling and chin na (pressure point techniques/eye gouges, etc.)

Jujutsu literally means ""Gentle techniques.""  It is called that, because jujutsu is very easy for the user to execute, but devastating for the opponent.  Samurai jujutsu is the predecessor of Judo, Aikido and Aikijujutsu. Jujutsu is the art from which most of the submission techniques originate, but is meant for unarmed defense against an armed opponent.  Judo is jujutsu but with the majority of the lethal techniques removed, and some more emphasis added on non-damaging submissions.  Only Judo, Brazilian jujutsu and other sport forms forego teaching defense against an armed assailant.  

Aikijujutsu originated from jujutsu, but changed dramatically as it was taught, and most techniques I've been exposed to use a person's own energy against them.  ~~Aikido is the tournament form of Aikijujutsu, and has some of the more lethal techniques removed.~~  Many comments below correct me on Aiki, so I graciously concede to them.

Tae Kwan Do is similar to karatejutsu in that a lot of it has been altered from the original towards what we have today which is a lot of footwork based martial arts involving almost exclusively kicking or less handwork.  Older forms of TKD are strikingly similar to Okinawan karatejutsu and Shaolin kung fu.  

Ninjutsu is basically a combination of Samurai jujutsu, some forms of striking techniques based off of jujutsu, and specialized stealth techniques involving distractions, using teamwork for traps, and assassination.  Ninja often used traps like hornet nests stuffed in jars to be thrown at pursuers, knives, or even had women working as geisha use their hairpins in order to dispatch targets."	0
"Littlehampton Town Football Club is a football club based in Littlehampton, England. It was established in 1896 and joined the Sussex County League in 1928. In the 1990–91 season, they reached the 1st round of the FA Cup. They are currently members of the  and play at The Sportsfield.

History
Littlehampton F.C. was formed in 1896, adding the Town suffix in 1938. The club became founding members of the West Sussex Football League in 1896, joining the Junior Division. In 1928 the club joined the Sussex County League. Despite finishing as runners-up in Division One on six occasions, they had to wait until 1990–91 before lifting the championship – the only time they have done so, having finished as runners-up to Wick the previous season – clinching the title on the last day of the season, at nearest rivals Peacehaven & Telscombe.

That season was undoubtedly the finest in the Marigolds’ history. As well as finishing as Division One champions, the club also reached the 1st Round of the FA Cup where they were beaten 4–0 by Northampton Town in front of a crowd of 4,000 at The Sportsfield. A League & Cup ‘double’ was completed with a 3–0 win over Burgess Hill Town. If that wasn't enough, Littlehampton also reached the semi-finals of the FA Vase, which remains the furthest that any Sussex club has ever progressed in the competition.

The following season, Littlehampton finished third behind Peacehaven & Telscombe and Langney Sports (now Eastbourne Borough). However, fortunes declined to the extent that they were relegated at the end of the 1994–95 season.

Two seasons later Littlehampton returned to the top division as champions of Division Two, and finished runners-up to Division One champions Burgess Hill Town in 1997–98. Once more however, the club suffered a sustained period of mediocrity, culminating in a miserable 2002–03 season, including a 22–1 defeat at Horsham YMCA; and relegation once again, ironically with Wick and Peacehaven & Telscombe... together, the three most dominant clubs in the early 1990s.

The club responded by investing heavily in the playing squad for 2003–04 and began the season as hot favourites to bounce back at the first attempt. This they duly did, finishing seven points clear of runners-up Worthing United. The two clubs also met in the League Cup final, with the Marigolds again coming out on top. There was no significant difference in the average attendance from the previous wretched season.

The club were the favourites of many to secure back-to-back championships, which was probably a little too ambitious. Nevertheless, they did well to finish in a creditable 4th place, a position they occupied once again at the end of 2005–06. Unfortunately, and as so often appears to be the case in West Sussex, the club lost manager Carl Stabler and most of the previous season's squad during the close season (many to Wick) and from being amongst the championship favourites the previous season, were now hotly tipped as relegation fodder. That proved to be the case and the Marigolds were always struggling throughout 2006–07, under new manager Trevor Waller, with a largely young and inexperienced squad.

The 2012–13 season saw the club finish as champions of Division Two, gaining promotion to Division One.

Littlehampton won the 2014–15 Sussex County Football League, finishing 1st. They however were not promoted after not applying for the Isthmian League. Their Twitter account said that ""we don't want to"", although it is likely they couldn't because their ground would not pass the grading test for Step 4 teams.

"  In order to investigate the contribution of diffuse components to their total
HI emission, we have obtained high precision HI line flux densities with the
100m Green Bank Telescope for a sample of 100 isolated spiral and irregular
galaxies which we have previously observed with the 43m telescope. A comparison
of the observed HI line fluxes obtained with the two different telescopes,
characterized by half-power beam widths of 9 arcmin and 21 arcmin respectively,
exploits a ``beam matching'' technique to yield a statistical determination of
the occurrence of diffuse HI components in their disks. A simple model of the
HI distribution within a galaxy well describes ~75 % of the sample and accounts
for all of the HI line flux density. The remaining galaxies are approximately
evenly divided into two categories: ones which appear to possess a
significantly more extensive HI distribution than the model predicts, and ones
for which the HI distribution is more centrally concentrated than predicted.
Examples of both extremes can be found in the literature but little attention
has been paid to the centrally concentrated HI systems. Our sample has
demonstrated that galaxies do not commonly possess extended regions of low
surface brightness HI gas which is not accounted for by our current
understanding of the structure of HI disks. Eight HI-rich companions to the
target objects are identified, and a set of extragalactic HI line flux density
calibrators is presented.

"There are these things running through your body called 'nerves'. When something is affecting you (heat, cold, pain, itching, anything at all), a thing in your skin called a 'receptor' recognises it. It wants to tell your brain what is going on, and it does this by sending a message through the nerves to the brain.

If you're sitting in a certain position for a long time, you can put pressure on a nerve that supplies part of your leg. Since the nerve is all squished, the information transmitted from the body part becomes all jumbled up, and the messages it sends to the brain becomes strange and confusing to interpret. 
Some nerves may not transmit any information at all!
Other nerves may start to send messages erratically and randomly! 

This is what causes you to feel the pins and needles ""tingling"" sensation.



EDIT: 
Thanks for all the interesting replies to my comment, lots of cool stuff to read :). Obviously there is a lot more depth to this than what I replied with, but i just tried to keep it as simple and compact as possible. I kinda just lumped the tingling/pins and needles you get with the numbness/falling asleep, because I'm not actually sure what happens! 
I'm only a medical student, and I'm replying on the basis of what a lecturer mentioned randomly for 15 seconds. I'm sure people doing degrees in neuroscience or something like that would have a more accurate answer to give."	0
We report on the detection by Swift/BAT and Konus-Wind of gamma-ray burst (GRB) 060927, which is one of only two events detected with redshifts greater than five to date.  The redshift was determined using optical spectroscopy obtained with the Very Large Telescope in Chile within three hours after the burst trigger time.  We find that this event has an extremely hard spectrum, similar to other high-redshift bursts observed previously.  Using our current understanding of the physics behind these phenomena we can estimate the total energy released during the prompt emission phase of the burst to be ~10^53 erg.  This value is comparable to or larger than the energies released by some supernovae.  If confirmed, it would make GRB 060927 the most energetic event ever recorded.  In addition, if the host galaxy mass function evolves similarly to what is seen locally, then the progenitor system responsible for producing such an energetic explosion must have been hosted by a very massive galaxy.  These results are consistent with theoretical predictions made about the progenitors of high-z GRBs.  Finally, we discuss how future observations of this object may help us understand the end of cosmic reionization.	1

"Fred Leonard Perrett (9 May 1891 – 1 December 1918) was a Welsh international rugby union prop who played club rugby for Neath. He won five caps for Wales, and in his first international game faced the touring South Africans.

Rugby career
Perrett originally played rugby for his local club Briton Ferry before eventually playing for Neath. While a member of Neath he earned his first Welsh cap against the touring South Africa team. Wales ran the South Africans close, but lost to a single penalty kick.

Perrett was reselected for Wales in the 1913 Five Nations Championship, one of only two Welsh players to appear in all four matches of the campaign; the other being Neath teammate Glyn Stephens. The two complemented each other well, especially during line outs. The Welsh team lost the first game against England, but won the final three games to finish second. Perrett may have been selected for further Wales matches, but turned professional at the end of the 1912/13 season, joining rugby league team Leeds, making his début on 6 September 1913, he later joined Hull F.C.

Perrett's league career was cut short by the outbreak of World War I. He joined the Welsh Guards, and served in France from 19 February 1916. He was subsequently commissioned as a second lieutenant, and transferred to the 17th Battalion of the Royal Welsh Fusiliers with seniority from 27 June 1917. He was seriously injured and died of his wounds in a casualty clearing station almost a month after the Armistice. He is buried at Terlincthun British Cemetery at Wimille in France. Perrett is often left out of lists of the Welsh international war dead due to his supposed defection to the professional game.

"This is a complex issue but I'll do my best to ELI5.

Risk factors for suicide are much higher for men than they are for women. These include severe mental illness, substance abuse, access to lethal means, and a higher rate of overtly aggressive behaiours. Furthermore, there are far fewer supports available for men than there are for women (e.g., if a woman's husband kicks her out of the home, there are likely women's shelters nearby, not so for men). The supports that are available to men are much less likely to be used due to stigma and stereotype surrounding men seeking help in relation to their distress, depression, grief, bereavement, etc.
The social aspect of support also comes into play here. Women are more likely than men to have a social group with whom they feel comfortable discussing their problems and experiences of low mood. We see this in the divorce literature that demonstrates post-divorce depression to be significantly higher in males than in females. 

In a nutshell, men have higher rates of suicide risk factors and fewer protective factors against suicide attempt and completion.

The queen bee is dead and they have no leader to guide them or protect them from predators. They will die off if left alone without any guidance, protection, food source etc.. The only way that this can be stopped would be by replacing their queen with another one who has not died yet. This could take years before it happens again as there may never be another queen born in time. There was an earthquake which killed her along with many other animals including humans. It also destroyed most buildings so she can't even live inside anymore like normal. She had been living outside until then but now it's too cold outdoors at night because winter's coming on fast. It's possible she's still alive somewhere else though since earthquakes don't always kill everything around you. An earthquake happened killing everyone except for two people (the narrator). One person survived due to being underground while the other lived above ground where he got hit by falling debris.	1
We study the concentration-mass relation for dark matter haloes in cosmological N-body simulations with different initial conditions and resolutions, focusing on the dependence on halo mass and redshift. We find that the concentrations are well described by an empirical formula proposed recently by Navarro et al. (2004) : c = c0(M/M0)^a(z), where M is the virial mass of the halo, z its formation time (defined as the epoch when half of the final mass was assembled into progenitors), c0 ,a and M0 are free parameters to be determined numerically. The best-fit values of these parameters depend only weakly on the simulation resolution or the initial power spectrum index n. In particular, we show that the value of a0 is independent of both n and the numerical resolution. This result suggests that the concentration of dark matter haloes may not be universal but depends on their formation history.	1
The BABAR experiment at SLAC has been studying CP violation in B mesons for more than ten years, and is now producing results on many topics related to this phenomenon.  This talk will give an overview of some recent results that have come out of BABAR's analysis program.   The first part will focus on measurements of CP asymmetries in decay modes with one or two neutral pions in the final state (B -> DK, D*K).   These decays are sensitive to new physics beyond the Standard Model through penguin diagrams involving charm quarks.   In particular, we will discuss how these decays can be used to measure the CKM angle gamma, which is not accessible by other methods such as tree-level decays like B -> J/$\psi$Ks.   We will also present preliminary results on searches for direct CP violation in these channels.   ... AMS-02 collaboration announces its measurement of cosmic ray positron fraction up to 1 TeV	1
";
, The skin and bone adds thickness to the chicken breasts, essentially doubling the amount of time they need to cook.

, These strips of chicken are very thin, so they usually finish cooking in 10 minutes or less. This amount of time also applies to boneless chicken breast cut into 2-inch (5-cm) pieces.

, The addition of a bone adds more cooking time to this cut. Moreover, as dark meat, thighs need to cook for a little longer than breasts.

, Since drumsticks have less meat on them than thighs, they do not usually need to cook for quite as long.

, Add another 10 to 20 minutes onto the cooking time for each additional 1 lb (450 g).

, The exact size stockpot you need may vary depending on how large your chicken pieces are and how much room they take up inside the pot. As a general rule, the chicken should take up roughly 1/4 to 1/3 of the space in your stockpot.


An 8-quart (8-liter) stockpot is fairly standard and will usually be enough to hold a whole chicken. A larger stockpot may be needed for birds bigger than 4 lb (1800 g), though.
You can use an 8-quart (8-liter) stockpot for boneless chicken breasts, but you could also opt for a smaller stockpot so that the water will boil faster.

, Pour enough cold water into the stockpot to cover the chicken completely.


Cold water is preferable to warm water.

, You can sprinkle anywhere from 1 tsp (5 ml) to 1 Tbsp (15 ml) salt into the water. A smaller amount is better for boneless chicken breasts and chicken tenders, but a larger amount may be better for whole chickens.


Note that the salt is only optional. You could boil the chicken without salt, but it will be much blander as a result.

, Cover the stockpot and boil the chicken on medium heat. Follow the recommended cooking time listed in this article for your cut of chicken.

, Place enough chicken broth into your stockpot to fill the stockpot halfway.

Chicken broth intensifies the flavor of the chicken, so it becomes less bland than chicken boiled in water.






You can use pre-made broth, but if you do not have pre-made broth, you can combine chicken broth granules with water. You usually need 1 tsp (5 ml) or one cube of chicken bouillon per 1 cup (250 ml) of water.






Use chicken stock instead of broth for an even richer, deeper flavor.







, Cutting the vegetables up allows more of the flavor to seep into the cooking liquid.

Peel the onions and cut them into halves or quarters.






Wash the carrots with water and slice them into 1-inch (2.5-cm) coins.






Rinse the celery and cut it into 1-inch (2.5-cm) slices.







, Transfer the chopped vegetables to the stockpot. The vegetables add dimension to the flavor of the broth.


Strictly speaking, the vegetables are not needed. Chicken can be boiled in plain broth.

, Transfer the chicken to the stockpot. If necessary, add more broth or water to the stockpot so that the chicken is completely covered.

, Bring the broth the a boil over high heat. Cover the pot, and reduce the heat to medium or medium-low so that the chicken simmers slowly.


Cook according to the recommended cooking times listed in this article.
Remove the chicken with tongs or a slotted spoon when done.






If desired, strain the cooking liquid and save the broth as stock for future recipes. You can store stock in the refrigerator for 3 days or in the freezer for 2 months.
You will likely end up discarding the vegetables used in this recipe, since the texture will turn mushy. The primary purpose of the vegetables in this recipe is to add flavor, not to serve as a side dish.

, Pile the chicken into your stockpot and cover with enough water and apple juice to completely cover the chicken.

For a stronger apple flavor, pour 2 quarts (2 liters) of apple juice into the stockpot before filling the rest of the stockpot up with enough water to cover the chicken.






For a more subtle apple flavor, pour equal parts apple juice and water into the stockpot simultaneously.






You could also use apple cider instead of apple juice. Apple cider tends to have a sharper taste, which some find preferable to the milder taste of apple juice.






Make sure that the combination of chicken, water, and apple juice fills between 1/2 and 3/4 of the stockpot.

, The savory taste of the vegetables in this recipe balances out the natural sweetness of the apple juice.

Peel the onion and cut it into halves or quarters.






Rinse the carrots under running water and cut them into 1-inch (2.5-cm) coins.






If using cloves of garlic, mince 4 cloves of garlic. If using garlic powder, use 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) of the seasoning.






You can use anywhere between 1 tsp (5 ml) and 1 Tbsp (15 ml) chopped fresh thyme. If using dried thyme, cut this down to 1/3 the amount.







, Disperse the onion, carrots, garlic, and thyme in the apple juice mixture.

, Bring the liquid up to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat so that the liquid only simmers, then cover and let cook according to the amount of time indicated in the ""cooking times"" section.

, About 10 minutes before the chicken finishes cooking, begin preparing the apple. Peel the apple, core it, and cut it into small slices.


The addition of the apple near the end of the cooking time will infuse an even stronger apple flavor into the chicken.

, Strain out the chicken when done and serve without any of the vegetables, fruit, seasonings, or cooking liquid.


The other ingredients serve to infuse the chicken with flavor as it cooks. The ingredients themselves, however, will be too soft and mushy to be very appetizing at this point.

, Add the dry white wine and chicken broth first. Then, fill the pot with enough water to reach the halfway point.

Wine can infuse chicken meat with a tremendous amount of flavor, but using too much could be overpowering.






Only use chicken broth in equal parts with the wine. Otherwise, the flavor of the chicken broth could end up competing with the flavor of the wine.






Dilute with water only as necessary.

, Toss the pearl onions, salt, pepper, garlic, parsley, oregano, and thyme into the cooking liquid.


Pearl onions do not need to be cut beforehand.






If you do not have pre-minced garlic on hand, you could mince or crush 6 cloves of garlic instead.






If using fresh herbs, add 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of each herb. For dried herbs, cut this amount down to 1 tsp (5 ml) each.







, Bring the cooking liquid up to a boil over medium-high heat. Let sit at this temperature for 2 to 5 minutes before reducing to a simmer.


Doing this allows some of the flavor of the seasoning to be released and some of the bitterness of the wine to cook off.

, Add the chicken to the cooking liquid using tongs. Bring the liquid back up to a boil before reducing the heat again.

, Cover the stockpot and boil the chicken at a steady simmer for the recommended cooking time indicated.


Serve the chicken only. The liquid and other ingredients are meant to add flavor, not to be served alongside the chicken.

"Section 2, Preliminaries:
There are serious issues with the random filter assumption (Section 2.1 and Section 4.1 are addressed together). First of all, we all know very well that random filters have extremely limited ability, especially with very deep networks. No one has in any way successfully applied random filters to deep networks. Second of all, their one-layer results in Table 1 is very off. For instance, [4] used one-layer unsupervised learning to train 1600 conv filters (this submission uses 2048 and 1024 conv filters) that achieved 77.9% accuracy on CIFAR-10, versus their 66% (random)/68% (learned), despite their architecture is far more complicated than [4], which ironically is far beyond the scope of their theoretical setup. But the most inappropriate component is the number of convolutional filters they used. None of the commonly used deep convolutional networks carry these many filters--for their first layer, there are about 30 times more filters than the dimension of its convolutional kernel! Recall that the most valuable part of convolutional layer is that it can use a small number of conv filters to extract abstract features by stacking many of them together. Unsurprisingly, as a consequence of using excessive amount of filters in order to span as much input space as possible, their models carry a huge number of parameters, an architecture design that is totally against the principles of CNNs. Finally, Table 4 shows, random filters can form a weight matrix that is a lot more “orthogonal” than learned filters. And such low coherence, i.e. “orthogonal” property of the weight matrix W, is the backbone of their Model-RIP. Thus some simple, unconvincing shallow networks do not manage to fill in the gap between random filters and learned filters, especially when this gap breaks their primary theoretical promise. 
 Notation in 2.2: The notations introduced in 2.2 are identical to the notations and problem set up used in [1]&[5] except that in [1]&[5], M = 1, which does not change the theoretical fundamentals. In addition, the terminologies such as “shift”, “block” are also shared between [1]&[5] and this submission.
There are serious issues with the Model-RIP setup: the model-RIP mathematical model is in fact nothing fancy. The only difference between model-RIP and a generic compressed sensing RIP model is that model-RIP requires model-sparsity. To be more straightforward, in this case, the model-sparsity corresponds with max-pooling—meaning sparsity is structured so that each pooling region only has at most 1 non-zero element and correspondingly, the assumption on the data space is that it is a linear combination of filters such that at most one filter from each pooling region is used. Note that this is the same assumption as appeared in [1] (see Appendix, equation S1), in fact, this assumption was originally proposed by the first author of [1]. However, the fundamental flaw of this model-RIP setup are first the lack of non-linearity, notice that if ReLU is added after the linear response then the activation can be very close to zero which makes the reconstruction has norm arbitrarily small/close to zero; second real weight matrix W cannot meet the conditions that random matrix can meet, in other words, real W is not even close to being “orthogonal”, even the authors give support along this direction (see Table 4). Hence the actual values of the reconstruction bounds in reality are far from being significant. 
(4)  IHT: This algorithm, again, does not take into any non-linearity on the activation into account.

"We present results on the MiniBooNE experiment, which has recently reported an excess in electron neutrino appearance events at low energies ($E < 100 MeV$). We show that this excess can be explained by adding two light sterile neutrinos to the Standard Model. The new states are required to have masses below $2\times 10^{-3}$ eV/c2 and mix strongly into the active neutrino flavors. In addition we find that there is no need for additional CP violation beyond what is already predicted within the Standard Model. This work was supported by the U.S.

We have identified more than 1000 infrared point sources associated with these clouds using our source extraction technique. These include protostars, young stellar objects, and background galaxies. In addition we find that there are many extended emission features which may be related to outflows or other phenomena associated with star formation. A comparison between the observed number counts at 24 microns and those predicted based on models of interstellar dust suggests that most of the detected sources are likely to be low mass stars surrounded by disks. This is consistent with previous studies of this region. However, it appears that some fraction of the brightest sources could also be high-mass protostars."	1
"The authors propose an interesting new way to train deep networks via the IB principle.  The idea is very appealing as it provides a principled way to learn representations which can be used both for prediction tasks (e.g., classification) but also for unsupervised learning problems such as clustering.   However I am not sure if their proposed solution works well enough on real-world datasets where there may exist many irrelevant features.    In addition they do not provide any theoretical guarantees about how close their approximate solutions will get compared to optimal ones obtained from solving the original optimization problem exactly.  

Overall though it's still worth reading because we have seen few papers proposing novel ways to use IB principles within deep architectures. 

Strengths: 
1. They demonstrate good empirical results across several benchmark data sets. 
2. Their work has potential applications beyond supervised/unsupervised learning"	1

"This paper proposes a new kind of expert model where a sparse subset of most reliable experts is chosen instead of the usual logarithmic opinion pool of a PoE.
I find the paper very unclear. I tried to find a proper definition of the joint model p(x,z) but could not extract this from the text. The proposed “EM-like” algorithm should then also follow directly from this definition. At this point I do not see if such as definition even exists. In other words, is there is an objective function on which the iterates of the proposed algorithm are guaranteed to improve on the train data?
We also note that the “product of unifac models” from Hinton tries to do something very similar where only a subset of the experts will get activated to generate the input:"	0
"  We present the latest developments of the MadGraph/MadEvent Monte Carlo event
generator and several applications to hadron collider physics. In the current
version events at the parton, hadron and detector level can be generated
directly from a web interface, for arbitrary processes in the Standard Model
and in several physics scenarios beyond it (HEFT, MSSM, 2HDM). The most
important additions are: a new framework for implementing user-defined new
physics models; a standalone running mode for creating and testing matrix
elements; generation of events corresponding to different processes, such as
signal(s) and backgrounds, in the same run; two platforms for data analysis,
where events are accessible at the parton, hadron and detector level; and the
generation of inclusive multi-jet samples by combining parton-level events with
parton showers. To illustrate the new capabilities of the package some
applications to hadron collider physics are presented:
  1) Higgs search in pp \to H \to W^+W^-: signal and backgrounds.
  2) Higgs CP properties: pp \to H jj$in the HEFT.
  3) Spin of a new resonance from lepton angular distributions.
  4) Single-top and Higgs associated production in a generic 2HDM.
  5) Comparison of strong SUSY pair production at the SPS points.
  6) Inclusive W+jets matched samples: comparison with the Tevatron data.

"The goal of this paper is to learn “ a collection of experts that are individually
meaningful and that have disjoint responsibilities.” Unlike a standard mixture model, they “use a different mixture for each dimension d.” While the results seem promising, the paper exposition needs significant improvement.

Comments:

The paper jumps in with no motivation at all. What is the application, or even the algorithm, or architecture that this is used for? This should be addressed at the beginning.

The subsequent exposition is not very clear. There are assertions made with no justification, e.g. “the experts only have a small variance for some subset of the variables while the variance of the other variables is large.” 

Since you’re learning both the experts and the weights, can this be rephrased in terms of dictionary learning? Please discuss the relevant related literature.

The horse data set is quite small with respect to the feature dimension, and so the conclusions may not necessarily generalize.

" This update installs the Home app, which you’ll use to control your HomeKit accessories.,

Check electronics stores for products (e.g., security systems, lighting, smart locks, etc.) that say “Works with Apple HomeKit” on their packaging.See http://www.apple.com/shop/accessories/all-accessories/homekit for a list of HomeKit accessories you can buy directly from Apple.

, This is how the Home app organizes your rooms and accessories:

Home: This is the highest level in the app. Each home contains rooms, which contain accessories.
Rooms: Your home will have at least one room. For example, you may add a room called Kitchen to your home.
Accessories: These are the HomeKit-enabled products in each room, such as smart lights and thermostats. You may have accessories in the Kitchen and Office rooms in your home.

, Every accessory is different, so you must follow its specific steps to prepare it for pairing with Home.,, In a few moments, you must snap a photo of this code to pair the accessory with Home. This 8-digit code follows the format 123-45-678 and can be found on the accessory or its packaging.,,

If this is your first time setting up Home, the “My Home” screen will appear.
If you’ve already set up a home and a room in the app, tap Home and select the room where the accessory is connected.

, Home will now scan for compatible accessories and display the results as square tiles.If you’re adding a new accessory to an existing room, tap +.

, The camera frame will appear., Home will snap the photo and pair with the device.If you’re unable to capture the code, tap Enter code manually to enter it with the keypad.

, This is helpful if you plan to use Siri to control devices.For example, if your overhead light appears as “Philips 24E633,” tap that and change it to “overhead light.”

,

There are some room names set up by default (e.g., Living Room, Bedroom). Tap one of those options to add your accessory to that room.
Tap Create New if you want to create a room with a new name.

,, It’s at the top right corner of the screen. The accessory is now paired with the Home app.Some accessories need additional setup steps. Refer to its manual to make sure there’s nothing else you need to do.

, A “scene” will let you control multiple accessories at the same time with a single tap. You’ll be able to select which accessories are included in the scene, as well as what happens when the scene is activated.For example, you could create a scene that will dim the lights, lock the door, and turn down the thermostat when you leave the house.

,,,, Tap one of the four suggestions (Arrive Home, Good Morning, Good Night, Leave Home) or click Custom to start from scratch.

The suggested scenes try to build a useful scene for you. For example, the Good Morning scene will automatically include the option to turn off compatible porch light.

,,, You’ll see a list of all accessories added to the scene., This is where you’ll set what happens to this accessory when the scene is active. For example:If you’re editing the Arrive Home scene, tap and hold the porch light and switch it to On.
You may also disarm the security system and start warming the oven.

, This gives your scene a test run so you can see it in action., This makes it so you can quickly turn the scene on and off from the Home tab and Control Center.,,, If you only have one, you should already be on this screen., Now you’ll see the accessories in this room as square tiles.

The tiles will also display the accessory’s current status, such as whether it’s on or off.
A thermostat should display the current temperature setting.
A light may report its brightness level as a percentage (e.g. 75%).

,, On some devices, you’ll see extra features on this screen. If not, leave it open and skip to the next step. Here are some extra features you may see: A temperature control panel for a thermostat.
A slider that controls lighting brightness.
A volume slider for a speaker system.

,, Now you’re back at the Room tab., If you created a scene (one action for many accessories) that includes accessories in this room, you’ll see it under scenes., From the home screen of your iPhone or iPad:Tap the Settings app.
Tap Siri.
Make sure the switch is in the On position.

,, Here are some examples:“Set the brightness of the bedroom light to 35%”
“Set the temperature to 67 degrees.”
“Turn on the porch light at the beach house.”
If you’re using a scene like Leave Home or Good Morning, you could say “I’m leaving” or “good morning” to activate the scene.

, You can use the iOS Control Center to quickly manage any accessories you’ve saved as Favorites.See Customizing an Accessory to learn how to add accessories to your Favorites.

, The main screen of the Control Center will appear., The Home controls are on the last screen of the Control Center. You’ll see a house icon at the top and your favorite accessories as tiles below.The tiles also report some information about each accessory, such as whether it’s turned on or off.

,, Like controlling accessories with the Home app, long-pressing a tile will bring up extra features for certain accessories.

For example, rather than tapping a light to turn it off, tap and hold it to reach the on-screen dimmer, then drag the dimmer to the desired position.

, If you added a scene to your favorites in the Home app, it will appear on this screen.,,, You can edit an accessory’s settings, such as its name, icon, and group settings, at any time., If you only have one Home, you’ll be there already.,,,, Enter a name that describes the accessory (e.g., overhead lighting, Bob’s speakers)., If you want to move the accessory to a different room, you can select the new room here.

You can also tap Create New to set up a brand new room.

, This adds a tile for this accessory to the Home tab and the Control Center.,, You can add a new room to your home at any time., It’s the center icon at the bottom of the screen., It’s the round icon at the top left corner.,,, The room will now appear in your home."	0
"Like you're Five:  On the day you get your allowance, you buy a bag of candy.  The next day, you want more candy, but you spent your allowance, so you ask your brother if you can borrow his allowance, and pay him back with your next allowance. You buy another bag of candy.  The next day you ask your sister if you can borrow her allowance, and promise to pay her back when you get your allowance. You buy another bag of candy.

When you finally get your allowance, you realise you're in trouble - you can't pay your brother and your sister.  You get so worried about it that you go buy a bag of candy instead.  When you get home, you get in a big fight with your brother and sister about it. 

When your Mom asks what you're fighting about, your brother and sister tell her that you borrowed money and you won't give it back.  She asks you why not, and you say that you spent all of the money on candy, and you don't have any money left.  She sighs, and makes you give all the candy you have left to your brother and sister.  They want to know when they get their money back, and she tells them the money is gone, and they need to stop fighting with you and forgive you.  They say that that isn't fair, and she says that it really isn't, and that they should remember this the next time you ask them for money."	0
"A personal communication asked whether there are cases in which a stochastic representation of the data can obtain a better value of the IB Lagrangian than any deterministic representation; in response to this, we added a remark in Section 3 saying that this indeed can happen. 

In response to a question by the reviewer, we added to Section 2 a few examples of nuisances that act as a group on the data.

We updated the MNIST and CIFAR experiments: all the qualitative results are the same as before, but we slightly changed the hyperparameters and the optimization method to provide a more accurate and fairer comparison between the algorithms.

Finally, we added an appendix to fill a gap in the narrative between Equation (2),  where the two distributions in the KL term were the actual prior and posterior of z, and Section 4, where we assume an approximated prior whose parameters are learned independently. Specifically, we show that if the approximated prior of the activations is chosen to be factorized, as we do, then our loss function differs from the actual IB Lagrangian by the total correlation of z. As a consequence, our approximation is correct when the components of z are mutually independent, and the loss function we use actually encourages this independence.

We would like to thank all the people that gave us early feedback on the paper."	0

"The authors propose an energy based GANs to solve some of its problems such as mode collapse.
In this work they use Wasserstein distance instead of Jensen-Shannon divergence in order to measure similarity between two distributions. 
They also introduce Energy-Based Discriminator (EBD) which is used for training discriminators with less parameters than standard one.  The proposed method shows better results on CIFAR-10 dataset compared to other state-of-the-art methods. 

Strengths: 
1. Proposed model solves many issues related to GANs like mode collapse etc..
2. Introduce EBD that reduces number of trainable parameters while maintaining performance.
3. Show good results on benchmark datasets Weaknesses: 
No major drawbacks are mentioned but there may be few minor ones"	1
We study the vibrational density of states (VDOS) of glassy materials using molecular dynamics simulations with anharmonic interactions between particles. We show that the VDOS can be decomposed into three main contributions: one at low frequencies corresponding to acoustic phonons; another contribution centered around the Debye frequency which is associated with optical phonons; and finally a third contribution located at high frequencies whose origin lies on the presence of unstable modes. The latter are responsible for the appearance of the so-called boson peak in the VDOS. In addition we find that these unstable modes have a strong tendency to form clusters or groups of correlated particles. Finally, by analyzing the spatial distribution of the unstable modes it becomes evident that they tend to localize near regions where there exist structural defects such as icosahedral-like motifs. This localization effect leads us to propose a simple model based on the existence of two different types of sites within the materials: stable ones characterized by their ability to support vibrations over large energy ranges, while unstable sites only allow small-amplitude oscillations.	1

Blu-ray players are devices which allow users to watch movies stored on discs as well as streamed from online sources such as Netflix.  They can also be connected directly to computers via USB ports so they act like external hard drives.   The first generation of these products was released by Sony Corporation under its PlayStation brand name but has since been rebranded as PS3s.    There were two versions available at launch; the regular version (PS3) and the slim model (PS3 Slim).   Both models feature backward compatibility with all previous generations of PlayStations including original PS1 games.   However, only the PS3 Slim supports 3D gaming while both support digital video playback through their built-in DVD/Blu-Ray disc drive.   This wikiHow will teach you how to set up any standard Blu-ray player regardless of what manufacturer made it.     Unpack your Blu-ray player. Before setting up your new Blu-ray player there...

"The authors propose to use direct sparse convolutional layers in combination with guided pruning for faster training of deep neural networks.
They show that their approach is able to train deeper models than previous methods while maintaining accuracy on ImageNet classification task. 
This work has several interesting aspects. 

First, it shows how sparsity can be used as an additional regularizer during network optimization which leads to better generalization performance.  Second, they introduce new techniques such as weight sharing between different filters within one layer (which reduces number of parameters) and batch normalization applied directly after convolution operation instead of before activation function.  
Thirdly, this method allows us to build very efficient model architectures without sacrificing too much accuracy.  

However there are some issues I would like to point out.    First,  although the proposed architecture achieves state-of-the-art results  its computational complexity remains high compared to other approaches.   Secondly,   the authors do not provide any information about hardware resources required to run these experiments so it's hard to judge whether the speedup achieved over baseline Resnet-50 implementation will translate into real-world applications.     Third,    the authors report only single value of top-1 error rate obtained from validation set but don't mention anything about standard deviation across multiple runs.    Finally,    the authors should try to explain why their technique works well when combined together rather than separately"	1
"The authors propose an unsupervised reward mechanism to encourage imitative behavior in robots.
This is very interesting work that has potential applications beyond robotics.  The proposed method can be used as part of any learning algorithm where there are multiple agents interacting with each other (e.g., multi-agent reinforcement learning). I think this could also have some impact on human-robot interaction research. 
I am not sure if it would make sense to use such rewards when training autonomous vehicles since they do not interact directly with humans but rather follow traffic rules. Strengths: 
1) This approach does not require explicit supervision from external sources like teachers/experts which makes it more practical than supervised approaches. 

2) It works well even without knowing how many different behaviors exist among all possible actions taken by the agent(s).

3) There may be several ways to extend their current framework so that it can handle continuous action spaces instead of discrete ones.  

Weaknesses: 

1) They only tested their model using simulated environments; therefore, it's unclear whether similar results will hold true under real-world conditions.    2) Their experiments were conducted over relatively short time periods compared to typical robotic tasks"	1
The consensus amongst reviewers' was that this paper, incorporating global context into classification, is not ready for publication. It provides no novelty over similar methods. The evaluation did not convince most of the reviewers. The paper seems peppered with unjustified and (as rather bluntly, but accurately, put by one reviewer) unscientific claims. Disappointingly, the authors did not respond to pre-review questions. Perhaps more understandably, they did not respond to the uniformly negative reviews of their paper to defend it. I see no reason to diverge from the reviewers' recommendation, and advocate rejection of this paper.	0
" Eighties alternative rock bands like The Cure are good places to begin. Look at songs besides their singles, and get a feel for the music. When you're ready, move onto less mainstream Gothic bands.;
, For the most part, the mainstream sounds that you will be used to are gone. The band Bauhaus is considered one of the most well-known and influential goth bands. Other good starting points can be found in punk and post-punk bands such as Joy Division, Siouxsie & the Banshees, The Damned, Sisters of Mercy or Christian Death. Later you may want to try more specific styles of Gothic music.

,, Artists known to play in this style are Jill Tracy, Salon Betty, Rozz Williams, Katzenjammer Kabarett, Voltaire and Rasputina.

,,,,,,,,, A huge part of ""Gothic"" music is appreciation of very meaningful and deep lyrics. You can search online for the lyrics. Listen to what they are singing about. The lyrics vary from deeply touching and profound to perforated with a macabre whimsy.

, This is a cool type of music. It has it's own sound, like all genres.

They have special foundations and walls that can withstand earthquakes better than older ones do. They also use steel beams instead of wood, which is more resistant in an earthquake. The floors may not shake as much if they are made out of concrete or brick rather than wood. Some newer homes even have rubber mats on their roofs so when it shakes during an earthquake there won't be any damage done by falling debris from above. Steel beams replace wooden ones because they're stronger against earthquakes. Concrete and bricks don't move around like wood does either.  Also some new houses will have rubber matting over them to protect your home's roofing system. This way no matter how hard the house rocks you wont get hurt! Newer building designs include special foundations and walls that make them less likely to collapse under strong ground motions caused by earthquakes. These structures often incorporate reinforced concrete slabs atop deep footings (foundations) into their design.	1
Slave owners' desire that they be converted stemmed from an attempt at controlling them and making sure they remained loyal servants, not because of any religious conviction on their part.  Slaves who became Christians would have no reason or incentive to run away since slavery had been justified by Christian doctrine as being God's will (and therefore morally right). They also believed that if slaves accepted Jesus Christ into their hearts then God would protect them in this life and give eternal life after death. Slavery was viewed as something sanctioned by god so converting slaves made sense to slave holders. It gave them control over those people whom they saw only as objects. Slaveholders wanted to make sure that slaves stayed with them forever. Converting slaves to Christianity helped keep them under control. Slaveowners felt it was necessary to convert slavesto Christianitybecause they thoughtslaverysomethingsanctionedbygodsoconvertingslavesmade sense totheirholders	1
We have performed simulations of nova explosions using the hydrodynamic code VH-1, which includes nuclear burning and convection. We find that changes to reaction rates can significantly affect the results of these calculations. In particular, we show how different choices for the 12C(p,γ)13N rate lead to differences in the predicted light curve shapes.  The inclusion of this reaction is important because it affects the amount of 13N produced during the explosion. This isotope decays by electron capture into 14O, which then undergoes β+ decay back down to 14N. If there are too many electrons present at late times (due to an overabundance of 13N), they will be captured onto protons instead of being emitted as positrons; thus, less energy will be released than if no such process were occurring. Our results suggest that the current uncertainty in the 12C(p , γ )13N rate may cause errors in the predicted luminosity of up to 50%.	1
"  Axions are expected to be produced in the sun via the Primakoff process. They
may be detected through the inverse process in the laboratory, under the
influence of a strong magnetic field, giving rise to X-rays of energies in the
range of a few keV. Such an Axion detector is the CERN Axion Solar Telescope
(CAST), collecting data since 2003. Results have been published, pushing the
axion-photon coupling g$_{a\gamma}$ below the 10$^{-10}$ GeV$^{-1}$ limit at
95% CL, for axion masses less than 0.02 eV. This limit is nearly an order of
magnitude lower than previous experimental limits and surpassed for the first
time limits set from astrophysical arguments based on the energy-loss concept.
The experiment is currently exploring axion masses in the range of 0.02 eV $<
m_a <$ 1.1 eV. In the next run, currently under preparation, the axion mass
explored will be extended up to the limit of 1.1 eV, testing for the first time
the region of theoretical axion models with the axion helioscope method.

" You lose weight when you burn more calories than you eat, so an inactive person who eats a lot of food will likely gain weight. The first step to losing weight is eating fewer calories. Track how many calories you eat in a day by writing down calorie information on all the food and drinks you consume. For foods that don't have nutrition labels, use the USDA Food Database to look up how many calories the item has.Find out how many calories your body needs to maintain your current weight by using an online calculator that takes your activity level into account. Try this one online www.bmrcalculator.org/.
A pound of fat has 3,500 calories in it.To lose a pound of fat each week, every day you should eat 500 calories less than what your body needs to maintain its current weight.;
, When you eat too much food, your body turns it into fat and stores it for future use. Read food labels to find out what an appropriate serving size should be. If you want to eat something without a label, check the American Dietetic Association Food Exchange list for proper serving sizes.Use measuring cups and a kitchen scale to make sure your servings match the recommended portion size.
Restaurants can be tricky because they usually serve extremely large portion sizes. Some restaurants post their nutrition information online, though. If possible, check the nutrition information beforehand and plan a meal between 500–600 calories.
Remember that you never have to eat the whole plate. Eat half your food to reach your calorie goal, then save the rest for later. You may be able to ask your server to put half of your meal in a to-go box before bringing out your food.
Some restaurants also have lighter menu options or half-portion sizes of their larger meals. Order off of this lighter menu whenever possible.

, Healthy fats like unsaturated oils should be the primary fat source in your diet. Cook with olive or canola oil instead of butter or lard. Other sources of healthy fats include nuts, seeds, avocados, fish, and natural peanut butter. Don't eat anything that has trans fat or lists the words “partially hydrogenated” in the ingredients list. You should avoid saturated fats as much as possible, limiting them to less than 10% of your total calories.


To calculate total calories from saturated fat, multiply the grams of fat by nine. For example, a food item with 5 grams of saturated fat has 45 calories from saturated fat.
Divide these calories by your total calories for the day, then multiply by 100. You want this final number to be less than 10.
For example, if I ate 210 calories from saturated fat and 2,300 calories for the day, I would have eaten 9% of calories from saturated fat.

, Processed foods go through some type of processing in a factory, and are usually found packaged in boxes, cans, bags, or other packaging. Often (although not always) they are higher in fat, sugar, and salt that can prevent you from losing weight. They also can lack a lot of the nutrients found in whole foods. Slowly eliminate processed foods from your diet by cutting two to three processed items per day. Replace them with whole foods like fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds.


Highly processed foods are an indicator it may be high in undesirable food qualities.
But just because a food is processed does not necessarily mean that is the case. There are many foods that are in packages that are quite good on a healthy diet, such as frozen vegetables, frozen fish fillets, or popcorn.
Also be aware that food that did not come from a bag, box, or the like may still be unhealthy. A chocolate brownie made from organic ingredients from scratch is still a brownie.
At the store, avoid the processed foods in the aisles by mainly shopping the perimeter, where the produce, dairy, meat and seafood, and bakery are. Only choose select items that are low-processed from aisles like the cooking aisle.
Make meals from scratch ahead of time and freeze them into portion sizes to be eaten during the week. Homemade soups with tons of vegetables are a great freezer option.Look for foods that have three or fewer ingredients on the ingredients list to avoid highly processed items.

, It has many health benefits, including keeping your digestive tract healthy, and keeping you feeling full longer so you don't overeat. Fiber is found in whole grains, fruits and vegetables, and nuts and seeds. Eat 25-30 grams of fiber each day with plenty of water.


Fruits that are high in fiber include raspberries, blackberries, mango, and guava.
Vegetables that are high in fiber include split peas, lentils, artichokes, and broccoli.

, Water is a major player in weight control. It helps flush metabolic waste out of your system, keeping your metabolism running high to quickly burn fat. Water will also keep you feeling full so you don't overeat. The adequate intake for men is 3 liters of water each day (about 13 cups) while women should drink 2.2 liters per day (about 9 cups).


If you take part in high activity exercise or cardio during the day or live in a very hot climate, you may need to increase your water intake.

, Instead of eating three large meals each day, eat six smaller ones. Your body can process food better in smaller amounts, resulting in less excess food being stored as fat. This can also steady your blood sugar levels and improve your absorption of vitamins and minerals.Just make sure these smaller meals are are made up of healthy, whole foods instead of processed food. You might consider this sample meal plan:


Meal #1 (8 a.m.): One medium banana with ½ cup of oatmeal.
Meal #2 (10 a.m.): A smoothie made with 1 cup of spinach, four medium strawberries, ⅓ cup of raspberries, 1 tbsp of flaxseed, and 8 fl oz of unsweetened almond milk.
Meal #3 (12 p.m.): One slice of whole wheat toast topped with one boiled egg and ¼ cup of mashed avocado.
Meal #4 (3 p.m.): 1 cup of salad topped with ½ avocado, ¼ cup cottage cheese, 2 tbsp of sunflower seeds, and a balsamic vinaigrette dressing.

, To achieve the best fat-burning results, start out by exercising for two hours and 30 minutes each week, then increasing it by 30 minutes every week. Combining both weightlifting and high intensity cardio is the best way to maximize fat-burning. Consider following this sample four-week workout schedule:


Sundays: Week One — 45 min. Cardio; Week Two — 45 min. Cardio; Week Three — 60 min. Cardio; Week Four — 60 min. Cardio
Mondays: OFF all four weeks
Tuesdays: Week One — 30 min Strength Upper Body; Week Two — 45 min Strength Upper Body; Week Three — 45 min Strength Upper Body; Week Four — 60 min Strength Upper Body
Wednesdays: OFF all four weeks
Thursdays: Week One — 45 min Cardio; Week Two — 45 min Cardio; Week Three — 60 min. Cardio; Week Four — 60 min. Cardio
Fridays: OFF all four weeks
Saturdays: Week One — 30 min Strength Lower Body; Week Two — 45 min Strength Lower Body; Week Three — 45 min Strength Lower Body; Week Four — 60 min Strength Lower Body

, Strength exercises can be done with weights, resistance bands, or just using your body weight. Try mixing up strength training exercises that work different muscle parts in the body. Start out at a slightly difficult weight or resistance and do three sets of 10 for each exercise or until failure. Once you can do that weight three workouts in a row (full three sets of 10) without failing, increase the weight or resistance by one level.


Exercises for the lower body include squats, calf raises, lunges, deadlifts, and leg press.
Upper body exercises include push-ups, sit-ups, chest press, overhead press, bicep curls, tricep dips, and lateral pull-downs.

, Cardio speeds up fat-burning, but it also has many other health benefits including decreasing your risk of cardiovascular disease.


Running, jogging or walking: If you start out walking, make it your goal to work up to jogging, then running.
Enjoy outdoor activities like sports, swimming, hiking, and biking.
If you belong to a gym, use its treadmills, ellipticals, bikes, and stair climbers.
Try interval exercises, like multiple sprints with jogging in between.
Switch between high intensity cardio and slower/longer endurance cardio for maximum fat burning.

, This is because lack of sleep causes changes in metabolism and fat-burning.These tips can help you get a good night’s sleep:Make sure the room is completely dark with dark curtains or sheets over the window.
Do not eat for at least two hours before going to bed in order to prevent heartburn or an increase in energy when you are trying to go to sleep.
Only use your bed for sleeping and sex. Do not do other activities such as watching TV, reading, listening to music, or working on the computer while you are in bed.

, Making small lifestyle changes throughout the day will help make your new habits stick. In the end, you will have made a positive change to a healthier lifestyle that you will be able to maintain long-term. Some small gestures you can make throughout the day to make a healthy lifestyle change include:


Take the stairs instead of the elevator.
Park in the back of the parking lot.
Start a hobby that involves you moving around, like hiking or biking.
Go to a weekly farmer’s market to buy fresh produce.
Start a garden of your own.

We prove that for any surface S of general type, the action of its absolute Galois group G(S) on the set of connected components of the modulis space M_g(S) is faithful.  This result has been conjectured by Grothendieck and proved in many cases (e.g., when g = 0 or 1).  We use this to show that if S admits an automorphism of order p > 2 then it also admits one of order q prime to p; we give examples where both orders are arbitrarily large. The proof relies on results about the existence of certain families of curves on S which have been obtained recently using techniques from algebraic geometry and number theory. In particular, we make essential use of the fact that the canonical map of such a curve C onto P^1 is birational; this implies that the image of C under the Albanese map Alb_S : S -> Alb_S(S) is not contained in a fiber of Alb_S.	1

"  We have used the ACS camera on HST to obtain (V,I) photometry for 57,000
red-giant stars in the halo of the Leo elliptical NGC 3377. We use this sample
of stars to derive the metallicity distribution function (MDF) for its halo
field stars, and comment on its chemical evolution history compared with both
larger and smaller E galaxies. Our ACS/WFC field spans a radial range extending
from 4 to 18 kpc projected distance from the center of NGC 3377 and thus covers
a significant portion of this galaxy's halo. We find that the MDF is broad,
reaching a peak at [m/H] ~ -0.6$, but containing virtually no stars more
metal-poor than log [m/H] = -1.5$. It may, in addition, have relatively few
stars more metal-rich than [m/H] = -0.3$, although interpretation of the
high-metallicity end of the MDF is limited by photometric completeness that
affects the detection of the reddest, most metal-rich stars. NGC 3377 appears
to have an enrichment history intermediate between those of normal dwarf
ellipticals and the much larger giants. As yet, we find no clear evidence that
the halo of NGC 3377 contains a significant population of ``young'' (< 3 Gy)
stars.

"The Appalachian String Band Music Festival (often referred to simply as ""Clifftop"") is a weeklong gathering of thousands of string band musicians and their friends from across the country and around the world, who each year since 1990 have assembled near the New River Gorge in West Virginia in late July/early August to celebrate the evolving tradition of old-time music and the community of people who keep it thriving by preserving and contributing to that tradition.

History
Though the Festival offers contests (traditional band, neo-traditional band, fiddle, old-time banjo, and flatfoot dancing), square dancing, several concerts and workshops, and other organized activities such as yoga, basket making, and hymn singing, the heart and soul of the Festival is found in the campsites, where old time music provides a foundation for all kinds of straight-off-the-strings acoustic music (including Americana, cajun, Celtic, swing, bluegrass, Dawg, and even reggae), which in turn often spontaneously generate impromptu dancing and other festivities by the people gathered within earshot.

Though the Festival officially starts the Wednesday before the first full weekend in August, the grounds start filling up the weekend before with well-adorned campsites, many of which have music being played through the night.  One of the Festival's unique features is the Neo-Traditional Band Contest on Friday, in which highest scores are given to bands that creatively extend the old time music tradition into other musical voices, instrumentation, and styles.

Over the years, the Festival has been frequented by accomplished Nashville musicians like John Hartford and Tim O'Brien and Leftover Salmon jam band leader Vince Hermann, legendary old time Appalachian musicians like Melvin Wine and Lester McCumbers, leading ""second generation"" old time musicians like Mike Seeger, Bruce Molsky, Rafe Stefanini, Brad Leftwich, and Ira Bernstein, and the youngest generation of old time musicians like Jake Krack.

The Festival takes place each summer at Camp Washington-Carver, in Clifftop, Fayette County, West Virginia, United States and is sponsored by the West Virginia Division of Culture and History.

"There's a lot of debate about this, and the answer is unclear. /u/SleeplessinRedditle quoted a study by Chen, who is an economist and not a linguist, but he makes several very basic errors: for example, he claims English has a ""strong"" future tense and German has a ""weak"" future tense, but in fact both languages express the future in almost exactly the same ways (he claims that English always requires a future marker except in very specific cases which he then sets aside, but this is completely false). His hypothesis also fails to explain why savings rates in different countries with the same languages vary so much: Ireland is near the top of the chart in the linked article, Australia near the middle, and the US and the UK right at the bottom.

The basic idea that language can affect how you think is known as the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis (although neither Sapir nor Whorf actually formulated it), and has been floated around and discussed since 1929: it's more correctly called ""linguistic relativity"". It comes in two basic versions: linguistic determinism says that the language you speak necessarily restricts the range of possible thoughts you can have and so dictates how you perceive things; linguistic influence says that the language you speak can have some effect on how you think and perceive in some ways, but doesn't dictate everything.

Chen appears to lean towards determinism; if you've seen *Arrival*, the scriptwriters basically took the determinist model of Sapir-Whorf and ran with it. Obviously, learning a new language can't literally rewire your brain to the extent that you can see all of time -- it makes a great movie, but scientifically it's bunk -- but the consensus among linguists at the moment is that there is no evidence at all to support the idea of linguistic determinism.

Basically, linguistic determinism says that before you can think, you must have language. People who speak languages that use the same word for ""blue"" and ""green"" can't tell the difference between those two colours.

However, research suggests the opposite: that we are all born able to think, and then we learn a language that enables us to express those thoughts. Somebody who speaks a language that makes no distinction between ""green"" and ""blue"" can still tell the difference between them: they just use the same label for them.

Anecdotally, this chimes in with my experience. Russian has different words for what we call different shades of blue: I can still see the difference between them, but I take longer than a native speaker of Russian to decide which word goes with which shade.

[This study](_URL_0_) suggests that the language does make a bit of a difference -- just not a big one.

Having lived in Germany now for nearly 25 years, I can say that learning the language hasn't made me better at saving money, or changed my perception in any meaningful way. There are some things I can express better in German than in English and vice versa: I don't *think* differently, but I am able to express a slightly different range of thoughts."	0

No, it's many atoms that are destroyed at once in an explosion of energy and light called nuclear fission. The atomic bomb is made up of two main parts: Uranium 235 or Plutonium 239 which contain unstable nuclei with too much energy to be held together by their own force fields.  When these materials are bombarded with neutrons from another source (like a reactor), they split into smaller particles releasing huge amounts of heat and radiation.   This causes them to explode violently as if there were no limit on how fast things can burn!

"The spots aren't, strictly speaking ""black"", they are ""no signal"" areas.

Sight is basically a chemical reaction. The rods and cones of your eyes produce dyes. (See ""Rhodopsin"" and/or ""visual purple"" et al.) These dyes are how your eyes see.

Photons come in, intersect, and change these dyes. This is what produces the initial chemical stimulus that becomes the nerve impulse response to light.

The photon(s) intersecting with the dyes ""uses up"" the dye.

Your body is constantly making new dye and cleaning up the used-up dye.

When you look at a bright light it uses up a lot of dye. Then those rods and cones don't have enough to really generate a good signal.

Similarly, if you've been in darkness for a while, you've got a lot of dye built up and you can see really well in the very dim light. Further the very dim light uses up very little dye and so you continue to see well in the dimness.

So this whole mechanism is why the room looks ""darker"" right after you turn off the lights, and then ""your eyes adjust"". It's also why the ""blue spots"" move with your eyeballs, because its the individual sensors that are exhausted.

(EDIT: yes, your eyes also _physically_ adjust to darkness or brightness by opening or closing the iris, but that's a different level of responsiveness. After two or three seconds the dark room will be somewhat more visible because of the iris thing, but it can take minutes for the dye levels to get good, and after half an hour the room might be really quite visually available. etc.)

So your eyes work on eye-fuel, and the more light they process the more of that fuel is exhausted. As it gets exhausted the cells that are exhausted put out less signal for the same light and ""dark patches"" seem to appear in your vision."	0
"Nicholas Altrock (September 15, 1876 – January 20, 1965) was an American professional baseball player and coach. He played in Major League Baseball as a left-handed pitcher between 1898 and 1919. After the 1919 season he continued to make periodic appearances as a pinch hitter for many years, until his final game at the age of 57. As a player, Altrock was a member of two World Series winning teams and then, won a third World Series as a coach. He was a coach for the Washington Senators for many years.

Biography
Altrock was born in Cincinnati, to German immigrant parents. He was one of the better pitchers in baseball for a brief period from  to  with the Chicago White Sox. He was instrumental in the White Sox World Series championship in 1906, going 20–13 with a 2.06 ERA in the regular season and 1–1 with a Series-best 1.00 ERA against the Chicago Cubs.

An arm injury after 1906 ruined his career, but he hung on with the White Sox and Washington Senators until , though he pitched very little after  and made sporadic pinch-hitting appearances after that, including one in  (facing Rube Walberg of the Philadelphia Athletics) at 57 years of age. He appeared in major league games in five decades, one of only two players to do this (Minnie Miñoso is the other); he is one of only 29 players in baseball history to have appeared in major league games in four decades.

Altrock became a coach for the Senators in  and remained on the Washington staff through , a 42-year skein that represents the longest consecutive-year tenure of a coach with the same franchise in baseball history. Some Senator scorecards continued to list Altrock as a ""coach emeritus"" even after his formal retirement.

During that time, he was noted for his antics in the coaching box and teamed with Al Schacht, the ""Clown Prince of Baseball"", for a dozen years to perform comedy routines on baseball fields in the days before official mascots. Schacht and Altrock also took their antics to the vaudeville stage where they appeared in a comedy routine. Ironically, at the height of their collaboration, Schacht and Altrock developed a deep personal animosity and stopped speaking with each other off the field. During their famous comic re-enactments of the Dempsey–Tunney championship boxing match, many speculated that they pulled no punches as they rained blows on each other.

An anecdote, probably apocryphal, has been printed in some baseball books about a quip by Altrock during his coaching days with the Senators. A batter had hit a ball into the stands and it was not known whether it was fair or foul. The umpire, who had been the target of Altrock's gibes, made the call and shortly afterward a woman was carried from the stands on a litter. The umpire asked Altrock if the ball had hit the woman. In his clear voice, Nick answered, ""No. You called that one right and she passed out from shock.""

He was the second oldest position player to play in a major league game when he played in 1924 at the age of 47.

Altrock lived for many years in the Columbia Heights neighborhood of Washington, D.C., with his wife Eleanor, and died at age 88 in 1965. He is interred at Vine Street Hill Cemetery in Cincinnati.

"If you're looking into playing sports at university then there are several things you'll want to consider before making this decision.  You may be wondering how much money you'd get paid if you were on a professional basketball team but it's important not to focus too heavily on these aspects when deciding whether or not to go pro as they can change over time.   It's also very important to remember that being a collegiate athlete isn't just about winning games; it takes hard work, dedication, determination, discipline, sacrifice, commitment, passion...and so many other qualities!   It'll take years (if ever) until you see yourself playing professionally - maybe never!  But that's okay because you've got plenty of time ahead of you!
The first step towards becoming a collegiate athlete involves getting noticed by scouts who will help you decide where you fit best academically and athletically.    Start by filming some game footagelike highlights of your favorite plays, rebounds,...etc. Send them along with a resume/stat sheet to schools whose teams you think you'd enjoy joining.  Make sure they're sent directly to the appropriate person such as:  Athletic Director Coach(es)  Don't forget to include contact information including phone number and/or email address.

If you've decided you'd like to become an oncologist,  you'll want to start planning now!   Start early!  You'll probably spend several years preparing yourself for med school if you plan to go straight after high school;  many people take time off between their bachelor's degree and entering med school.  

You might consider getting involved in some extracurricular activities during college which relate to health sciences and/or medicine..  For example, you could volunteer at a local hospital, medical clinic, nursing home, etc.."	1
"The authors present an interesting approach to solving Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) partial differential equations using neural networks trained on data generated from recursive regression.
This is not exactly new research but it does provide some insight into how this type of equation can be solved in practice.  The main contribution here seems to lie more so in the training process than anything else - that being said there are still several issues worth noting.  

First off I think it's important for readers who aren't familiar with these types of problems to understand why they need to solve them at all.   In particular I'd like to see something about how one would use such solutions as part of their overall strategy when playing games where optimal control theory plays a role.    This could include things like:  How do you know if your solution actually solves the original problem?"	1
"40 Tenth Avenue (originally referred to as Solar Carve) is an office building currently in the finishing stages of construction in New York City.  The structure is adjacent to the High Line.

Planning and development
The building was first proposed in 2012, with designs released to the public then. Plans were later approved in 2014. Construction began in 2017 Advanced by Cauldwell Wingate Company and the project received $120 million in construction financing from Bank OZK in September 2017. The building topped out in early 2018 and was completed in late 2018, with the first tenants expected to move in to the building in March 2019.

Hyundai's luxury car brand Genesis signed a lease for all  of retail space in the building in December 2017. In March 2019, Starwood Capital Group signed a lease for the building's eighth floor.

Design and reception
40 Tenth Avenue is Studio Gang's first commission in New York. The building features a chiseled, diamond-shaped curtain wall that was engineered to eliminate shadows cast onto the adjacent Highline Park. Additionally, the facade allegedly minimized heat gain, reduced glare for drivers on the West Side Highway, and discouraged migratory birds strikes. The 12-story building includes  of outdoor space and  high ceilings. 

Justin Davidson, writing for New York, referred to the structure as ""...one of the most exciting chapters in the future of the High Line."" Similarly, Architectural Digest named the building one of their ""14 Most Anticipated Buildings of 2019"".

It was an accessory that allowed you to cheat in games by entering codes into it and then inserting them into your game cartridge or disc. It also had cheats built right in, so there were no extra steps needed when using these devices. The device would be inserted directly onto the console's slot where cartridges go (NES) or on top of the Sega Master System unit itself. This is how they worked with NES/Master systems: They are cheating devices used to make life easier while playing video games. You can enter codes through this device which will allow you to get items faster than normal speed etc.. These devices have been around since the early 90s but became popular during the late 80s/early 90s era. Cheating devices like this one made their way back from Japan as well.

"Before any concept of subatomic particles, people knew about atoms and elements via a wide array of experiments (which could be detailed, but isn't really relevant to this story).  When you have a purified sample of an element, you can determine how much an atom of it weighs, and so we start with knowing a bunch of elements and their atomic weights.

Enter Dmitri Mendeleev.  He notices that if you arrange the elements by increasing weight, you end up with repeating groups of elements that are chemically similar.  This was nice, except people knew something wasn't quite right with it, because you had to do a couple tricks to make similarly-acting elements end up in the right groups (such as swapping the by-weight ordering of tellurium and iodine or cobalt and nickel).  Once this was done, the elements gradually got numbered using their place in the table: 1 is Hydrogen, 2 is Helium, etc.  The numbers didn't mean anything to anyone, they were just useful identifiers, and they were called atomic numbers.

Later, Joseph J. Thomson is working on figuring out what is going on in electric discharge tubes.  He discovers that tiny particles are being discharged from the cathode in those tubes, and he managed to measure the ratio between their charge and mass.  He calls those particles electrons.

Next we go to Ernest Rutherford.  He had an experiment where he fired a bunch of positively-charged particles at a thin sheet of gold leaf, and he noticed that the vast majority of them made it through without interacting with anything, but a few of them got deflected.  This led him to hypothesize that atoms had a dense central core of positive charge (the nucleus) and then a diffuse cloud of electrons around it.  Since atoms overall usually have neutral electric charge, the number of electrons and the charge of the nucleus had to be equal.

Following on from this was Henry Moseley.  He measured the wavelengths of X-rays sent off by various elements in a particular kind of experimental setup, and he determined that the wavelength was proportional to the square of the atomic number.  That indicated that the atomic number actually indicated a physical quantity, which was then hypothesized as the amount of charge in the nucleus.  One of the neat things this did was conclusively show where there were gaps in the periodic table: elements that should exist, but hadn't been discovered yet.  In the course of time, all those gaps were filled in, once people knew what to look for.

Back to Rutherford again, a few years later.  He succeeds in experimentally stripping out everything but the nucleus of a hydrogen atom, which has a charge of 1 and a weight of 1.  He calls what he ends up with a proton.

Finally, we need to discover the neutron.  We already know that the nucleus has a positive charge of the atomic number, and thus there are that many electrons as well, but the problem is that most atoms have a much higher weight than their atomic number, so something more than protons had to be in the atomic nucleus.  A leading theory was that there were a bunch of extra proton-electron pairs just hanging around in the nucleus, but that was shown to be impossible.  Enter James Chadwick, who shot a weird kind of radiation others had discovered at paraffin and other substances and measured what happened, and concluded that the radiation was in fact made up of neutrally-charged particles that had about the same mass as a proton.  He's discovered the neutron.

So, now that we know everything, we can gather up our data on elements.  The number of protons in an atom is the atomic number of that element.  That's also the number of electrons, since atoms are neutrally-charged.  Finally, the difference between the atom's weight and the atomic number is the number of neutrons."	0
"The main idea of this article is to use deep neural networks (DNNs) in function approximation problems.
In order to do so they introduce two new algorithms called DQN and DDQN which are based on Q-learning with experience replay memory. 
They show that these methods can be used successfully as an alternative approach compared to other state-of-the-art techniques such as LSTM-RNNs. 

Strengths:

- The authors present their work clearly - They provide experimental results showing how well their proposed method works 

Weaknesses: 
- It would have been nice if there were more experiments done using different datasets/functions - There isn't much discussion about why it might not perform better than RNN-LSTMs? What could go wrong? 

Overall I think it's interesting research but some additional experimentation should be performed before publication"	1
"The authors present HolStep as an open source dataset of higher order logic theorem proving problems that can be used to train machine learning models.
They provide some examples on how they have already applied their data set in practice using neural networks trained with TensorFlow. 
I think this is very interesting work because it provides researchers working on automated reasoning algorithms (e.g., SAT solvers) access to large amounts of training data which will hopefully lead them towards more efficient solutions. 
 
 The main strength I see here lies in the fact that these datasets are publicly available online so anyone interested may use them without any restrictions whatsoever.  
 
 However, there seems to me one major drawback when compared against other similar resources such as TPTP or SMT-LIB. While those two libraries contain many different types of theories from various domains ranging from mathematics over computer science up to artificial intelligence theory, HolStep only contains theorems related to computational complexity theory. This means that while you might find useful information about certain aspects of your algorithm within its scope, if you're looking at something outside of computational complexity theory you'll probably not get much out of it."	1
" They are self-serving, arrogant and a bit intimidating. They command people left and right, even when they are not in the position to be giving the orders. (See the Enemy Within, char: Charles Kawalsky);
, Be arrogant, but do not be a bastard. There is a difference.

, They are known for their elaborate clothing. Take a look at the clothing of people today if they go into battle. Tight, form fitting, usually pants. The Goa'uld (even the male personality ones) wear things like long dresses and loose clothing. They don't fight using strength and hand to hand combat because they have technology that allows them to pwn your face from afar. It's kind of ridiculous seeing that the symbiote gives the body increased strength and everything.

, They wore chain mail looking outfits showing no more than their hands and face. In the movie, Stargate, the guards wore schenti, sandals, a top (usually midriff bearing) and their totem masks.

, In today's world, that's your choice. Many people are starting to get interested in the older style of things, so you may not look too alienated if you went the elaborate clothing style versus the war mode style.

,, They'd be very commanding and intimidating, blasting people around with their hand device and ribboning everyone into submission.

, This is the chainmail style that looks reminiscent of Ancient Egyptian style, but updated for the sci-fi look.

, They achieved the blend of sci-fi and Ancient Egyptian culture very well. I think it was probably the colors and the fact they wore actual loin cloths instead of a weird rigid schenti.

, Take an acting class to learn how to speak more fluidly and move in a controlled manner. Walk and talk slow as if the world needs to slow down and move at your pace. Learn to control conversations you enter into. Act mostly non-interested in other people and as if you have more important things to attend to.

, Acting like a Goa'uld can lead you to be loved by many people because if done correctly, you can come off very strong and sure of yourself rather than a tyrant and rude bastard.

, Apophis was not above making Sokar think he was all loyal and following of him. Therefore to be a Goa'uld you must be cunning and sneaky. Never let anyone in on your plans unless they have undying loyalty for you. Note: This can not be a person who is of very high self esteem or arrogant themselves, it may eventually lead into a battle of who is more powerful of the two of you, literally. Conceal your motives.

, Money is power in today's world. Money can earn you the loyalty and respect of people because they follow the person with the most paper in their pockets. These are the flunkies that eat out of every rich person's palm. Get wealthy and then protect your wealth. Invest and build a literal empire.

, So, do not neglect your followers. Goa'uld mostly played on their claim to divinity and using their technology to look Godlike. Unfortunately, this tech is not available to do that. So, do not treat your underlings like crap. That's why there are many revolts going along. Listen to your followers, do not allow them to get out of line, but listen to them. People will follow a reasonable ruler who is down their in the fray with them rather than a removed ruler who makes it appear as if they do not matter to them.

, Goa'uld are not real and neither is Stargate. Behaving too strictly to this list may earn you a beating from people who don't like your attitude. Don't pick up behaviors that you can't back up.

"Isabel Colton Greene, known as Belle C. Green (March 17, 1842March 10, 1926), was an American author of humorous novels.

Early life
Isabel (nickname, ""Belle"") Colton was born in Pittsfield, Vermont, on March 17, 1842. Her ancestors were a mix of American, English and Native American. One of her ancestors on her father's side married a Native American princess belonging to a Massachusetts tribe, and settled in that state. Her mother, Lucy Baker, came from Puritan stock; she died at the age of 47, leaving her husband and a family of six girls. Isabel, who was next to the youngest, was four years old at the time. She was taken into the family of a distant relative living in Nashua, New Hampshire, where she was reared and educated in strictest orthodox ways.

Career
It was not till the year 1881 that Belle Greene began her literary work in earnest. She sent a short story and a humorous sketch to her friend, Elizabeth Stuart Phelps, asking for advice and encouragement. Phelps replied with characteristic honesty and kindness that Greene's voice was doubtless her one great gift, and, as mortals were seldom blessed with two, she advised her to stick to music, but added, since she must give an opinion, that she considered the humorous sketch better than the story. Upon this scanty encouragement Greene offered the humorous sketch to Godey's Lady's Book, and it was accepted. She continued to furnish sketches for a year or more, and concluded her work for the magazine by writing her first story proper, a novelette, afterward published in book form under the title A New England Idyl (1886).

She wrote also for Youths Companion and Harpers Weekly.

Adventures of an Old Maid (1886), a second book, was a collection of humorous sketches published first in the magazines, and sold over 75,000 copies. Her religious novel, A New England Conscience (1885), attracted wide comment. Though severely denounced by some of the critics, it was regarded by others as a masterpiece of condensed thought and realistic character drawing.

Other works include: Mr. and Mrs. Hannibal Hawkins (1897), The hobbledehoy; the story of one betwixt boy and man (1895), Hobbly Dr. Hoe (the story of a man who attempted to understand the mind of a boy).

In 1887–88, Greene made an extended tour of southern California and the Pacific Coast, and during her stay of several months in Los Angeles and San Diego she contributed to the newspapers a series of humorous sketches founded upon the phases of the boom, which added greatly to her reputation as a humorous writer. These last-mentioned articles constitute her only newspaper work, with the exception of the Mill Papers, regarding the operatives in the cotton-mills, written for the Boston Transcript in 1883 and 1884.

Personal life
In 1868, Colton married Martin Van Buren Greene, of Nashua, New Hampshire. They had one son, Edward Martin Greene, who became Professor of Romance Languages at the University of South Dakota. Edward was his mother's constant companion on several trips across the continent to California, as well to Europe.

She used to spend summers with her sister in Palatine, Illinois, since 1910. She died there on March 10, 1926, and is buried at Hillside Cemetery.

Her grandson, John Colton Greene, a former president of the History of Science Society and winner of its 2002 George Sarton Medal for outstanding scholarly achievement, was a Professor of History at the University of Connecticut.

" There is no doubt that it is absolutely simple. You will need:


1 Rubber Band
1 Sheet of Paper
Scissors or Ruler (Optional);
, Take your piece of paper. Cut or tear the piece of paper into smaller pieces with your hands, scissors, ruler, etc. The small papers should be roughly near 7 cm by 1 cm. Scrunch up the small pieces of paper into a good-sized, tight and firm paper ball. This will be called a mini-paper bullet. Make a few more bullets to add to your ammo stock.

, Wrap it around your thumb and index finger. Make sure to put the rubber band on your default hand (hand that you usually use).

, Pinch it with your thumb and index finger of your other hand. Don't let go of the bullet.

, If you are pulling the closest band towards you, you are doing it correctly.

,,, Pull the band that is further away from you towards you. This will overlap the band that is closest towards you. Do not pull the band closest towards you.

,,,, This time, pull both bands.

,, The tricky part is coming up. Although it is easy to do practically, describing it in words is a different matter.

, Pull it under the band farthest from you.

, Hold the bullet by pinching it with your thumb and index finger of your other hand.

,,,, That is, wrapped around your thumb and index finger.

, Twist the band you are holding and place it in the base of your middle finger. Your middle finger should be resting near the middle of your palm.

, Pull back the rubber band with the bullet.

,, Whether in school, home, or work, you've got to hide your masterpiece of fun. In school, you might shoot your bullets across the room but you should hide your weapon so that people aren't suspicious of you. You certainly don't want your enemy or other people using your weapon. The best hiding spot for your bullets is your pocket. Shorts pocket, jacket pocket, all are fine. Hiding it in a pocket is another good thing because your hand could reach it easily.

, Pretend to be writing or pretend to be doing something with your hands. The person you shot might think that your working hands means that it is too busy for games.

, The rubber band makes a twanging sound after firing the bullet so it is a good idea to hide it quickly. If you have a watch, you could use it to cover up your rubber band. Or else you put it inside a pocket or put it next to other bracelets or things on your arm to make it look like everyday stuff.

You might not get it to shoot well at first, but remember to place the bullet in the right place so the power will go into the bullet. Don't forget to read the tips below to learn more

"Air Command is the operational arm of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). It is headed by the Air Commander Australia, whose role is to manage and command the RAAF's Force Element Groups (FEGs), which contain the operational capability of the Air Force. Headquarters Air Command is located at RAAF Base Glenbrook.

Structure
Air Command consists of the following FEGs:
Air Mobility Group
Air Combat Group
Surveillance and Response Group
Combat Support Group
Air Warfare Centre
Air Force Training Group

Air Command has a critical strategic role both in peacetime and wartime. It works closely with Air Force Training Group (formerly RAAF Training Command) and the Australian Defence Force's Joint Logistics Command in developing and maintaining the nation's defence capabilities.

Commanders
The Air Commander is responsible for all operational Air Force tasks, and reports to the Chief of Air Force. The Air Commander raises, trains and sustains forces for assignment to operations under the Chief of Joint Operations (CJOPS).  Similar arrangements exist with Commander Forces Command (Australian Army) and Commander Australian Fleet (Royal Australian Navy).

Air Command has undergone a number of changes since its formation in May 1942, both in name and location. The following table lists those Air Force officers who have been appointed to lead the command and its headquarters in its various incarnations.

Note: The official title of each group of Commanders is listed immediately after the name of the Command.

They want their jobs and homes back from them, as well as other things they feel entitled too that were taken away by the boomers when they came of age in society. They also believe that if there is less competition then it will be easier for younger generations to succeed because there won't be many older people trying to do what they're doing now. Some may even think it's better without any elderly at all since they'll have no one else to take care of but themselves. Because there's more competition with young adults than old ones. It's harder to get ahead these days unless you go into business or something like that where you're competing against others your own age who can relate to how hard life has been recently. There aren't enough jobs available anymore either which makes getting ahead much more difficult.

"We present the first exact solution for inflation in string theory, which is based on an explicit compactification to four dimensions with N=1 supergravity and chiral matter fields. The model contains two scalar fields, one of them being responsible for slow-roll inflation driven by its potential energy density. We show that this field can be identified as the inflaton. In addition we find another scalar field whose kinetic term has negative sign. This field may play the role of dark radiation during inflation. Finally, we discuss some phenomenological consequences of our results. Introduction: Inflation [1] provides a simple explanation for many puzzles associated with the early universe such as flatness, homogeneity and horizon problems [2] . It also predicts primordial fluctuations [3] , which are now confirmed by observations [4] .
The simplest models of inflation involve only one scalar field (inflaton) rolling slowly down its potential [5] . However it was shown recently [6] that there exist more general classes of inflationary scenarios where several scalars contribute to the total energy density driving inflation [7, 8] . These new possibilities open up interesting avenues towards understanding the physics behind inflation [9] .
In particular, if at least one of these scalars has positive kinetic energy then it leads to so-called k-inflation [10] . On the other hand, if all the scalars have negative kinetic energies they lead to so-called ghost inflation [11] . Both types of inflation were studied extensively in recent years [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59 ].
It should be noted however that most of these studies assume that the background geometry is given by Minkowski space-time or anti-de Sitter space-time [60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65,"	1

"Raxibacumab  is a human monoclonal antibody intended for the prophylaxis and treatment of inhaled anthrax. Its efficacy has been proven in rabbits and monkeys. In December 2012 raxibacumab was approved in the United States for the treatment of inhalational anthrax due to Bacillus anthracis in combination with appropriate antibacterial drugs, and for prophylaxis of inhalational anthrax when alternative therapies are not available or are not appropriate.

The antibody was discovered in a joint venture between Cambridge Antibody Technology and Human Genome Sciences. Cambridge Antibody Technology discovered the antibody to Human Genome Sciences's target and, in 2012, HGS were purchased by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). In 2017, it was acquired by Emergent BioSolutions

Side effects 

The most commonly observed adverse events are headaches, upper respiratory tract infection, nausea, pain in extremity and pruritus skin itching.

Pharmacology 

Raxibacumab injection is a monoclonal antibody targeting the protective antigen (PA) component of the lethal toxin of Bacillus anthracis.

Development history 

Raxibacumab was developed by Human Genome Sciences (HGS) in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) under contract number HHS010020050006C. At the 2 November 2012 meeting of the Anti-Infective Drugs Advisory Committee to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) members ""voted 16 to 1 in support of the clinical benefit of raxibacumab for the treatment of inhalational anthrax, with one abstention.  In addition, the committee voted 18 – 0 in favour of the risk-benefit profile of raxibacumab"". In 2009, support from the FDA was denied after it ""expressed doubt on the agent's added benefit over the antibiotic levofloxacin (Levaquin) alone"". On Dec. 14, 2012, FDA approved raxibacumab injection to treat inhalational anthrax, a form of the infectious disease caused by breathing in the spores of the bacterium Bacillus anthracis. Raxibacumab also is approved to prevent inhalational anthrax when alternative therapies are not available or not appropriate.

"Laventille is a ward of Trinidad and Tobago.

Etymology
The name Laventille hearkens back to colonial times, especially when the French dominated the cultural traditions of the island. One etymological derivation of the name is because the northeast trade winds come to this part of the island of Trinidad before reaching any other part of colonial Port of Spain – hence the metaphorical name La Ventaille (""The Vent""). Geographically, it is the source of Orographic precipitation for the capital city.

Arts and culture
Laventille is the place where steel pan was born, and it is the birthplace of innovators and world-renowned tuners like the late Rudolph Charles, Bertie Marshall and Roland Harrigin.  It is the heart of the steelpan world, where pioneer Winston ""Spree"" Simon lived and created one of the century’s new acoustical musical instruments. It is home to Desperadoes Steel Orchestra, one of the world's oldest steelbands, still in existence today. It also houses several other bands such as Laventille Hilanders, Courts Laventille Sound Specialists, Tokyo, etc.

Laventille is also the birthplace of many people including Soca artist Destra Garcia. Laventille is probably the oldest Community in East Port of Spain. It has been said, whenever the enslaved peoples escaped from man's inhumanity to man, they headed to the Hills of Laventille.

The name has also been used as a general term for the neighbourhoods of eastern Port of Spain, including not only Laventille ""proper"" (Success Village, Trou Macaque, Never Dirty) but also East Dry River,Saint Joseph Road, Saint Paul Street, Piccadilly Street, Hill View/Block 8, Beverly Hills, Canada, Afrika, South Quay, Parsley Street, Picton, Plaisance Road, Essex Road, Lodge Place, San Juan, Success, Pump Trace, Sogren Trace, annisette Street, Bath Place, Foster Road, Eastern Main Road, Rock City, Dan Kelly, John-John, Sea Lots, Beetham Estate Gardens, Caledonia, Maryland, Mon Repos and Chinapoo.

Events

Coopers trained at Angostura
In 2015, over a three week period young persons were trained in the art of coopering at Angostura. This training involved the making of barrels from scratch. These barrel which can be used to store the ""work in progress of rum"" are an intrinsic part of the creation of the rum product.

Economy
The world famous Angostura Bitters is currently produced at the Angostura compound which is located off the Eastern Main Road in Laventille. This product is one of the older products of Trinidad and Tobago which has won many awards and which has been exported to many countries. The bitters forms an essential element in many drinks and dishes.

Many of the rums which are produced in Trinidad are made at the Angostura Compound. These rums are exported to many countries and earn valuable foreign exchange for the country. These rums are also used in ponche a creme, the local equivalent of egg nog.

For many years, MacFoods Meat processors was one of the larger employers in the area, as their factory produced top quality pork hams, marketed under the label ""Blue Ribbon"" hams.

Angostura Museum and Barcant Butterfly Collection

The Angostura Museum and Barcant Butterfly Collection are located in the Angostura compound, Eastern Main Road, Laventille.   The compound is located on 20 acres of land at Trinity Avenue and Eastern Main Road. This compound is located just on the outskirts of Port of Spain, heading towards Morvant. Access is obtained through the Eastern Main Road entrance.  In addition to the Museum, there are several buildings which are located on the compound, such as the Distillery, the Administration Offices and the Special Events Buildings for which bookings can be placed.

Fernandes Industrial Centre (FIC)

The Fernandes Industrial Centre (FIC) is located along the Eastern Main Road, close to the Morvant Junction. The FIC stretches from the Main Road, is intersected by the Priority Bus Route and continues to the Churchill Roosevelt Highway (CRH). However the Compound is not accessible from the CRH. The Centre offers warehousing, distribution and operating space for several different types of businesses, some of these are: Foundation for the Enhancement and Enrichment of Life. This Non Governmental Organization (NGO) was founded by Mr. Clive Pantin, brother of the late Archbishop Anthony Pantin of the R.C. Archdiocese of Port of Spain,  former principal of Fatima College. The organization is engaged in the collection, distribution of food items to those in need and other social services. Peter Sheppard Studio ~ Peter Sheppard has produced artwork which recreate historical scenes of Trinidad and Tobago.

"The authors propose a new way to regularize CNNs called ""OrthoReg"" which constrains the correlation among different layers within each layer group (e.g., convolution kernels). The idea behind their approach seems very promising as it can be easily applied to existing architectures without requiring any changes at inference time. 
 
 They also provide some theoretical analysis showing how OrthoReg improves generalization performance under certain conditions. Finally, experiments conducted on several datasets demonstrate its effectiveness against other popular methods such as DropOut and BatchNorm. 
Overall I think it's a great work! 
Strengths: 

1) It provides both theory and experimental results supporting the proposed method. 

2) It's easy-to-apply because no additional computations need to be done during testing phase.  

3) It works well across various network structures including FCNs/CNNs"	1
"This paper proposes a new method, interior gradients, for analysing feature importance in deep neural networks.  The interior gradient is the gradient measured on a scaled version of the input.  The integrated gradient is the integral of interior gradients over all scaling factors.  Visualizations comparing integrated gradients with standard gradients on real images input to the Inception CNN show that integrated gradients correspond to an intuitive notion of feature importance.

While motivation and qualitative examples are appealing, the paper lacks both qualitative and quantitative comparison to prior work.  Only the baseline (simply the standard gradient) is presented as reference for qualitative comparison.  Yet, the paper cites numerous other works (DeepLift, layer-wise relevance propagation, guided backpropagation) that all attack the same problem of feature importance.  Lack of comparison to any of these methods is a major weakness of the paper.  I do not believe it is fit for publication without such comparisons.  My pre-review question articulated this same concern and has not been answered.

"The authors present their work on energy-based spherical sparse coding as part of a larger effort towards building deeper models that can be used for image recognition tasks.  The proposed method is based off of previous research by the same group but extends it significantly.
I think it's important to note here how much more complicated the problem becomes when trying to build such networks compared to traditional shallow architectures like VGG or ResNet.   This complexity comes from two sources - first there needs to exist some way to train each individual component network so they learn useful features;  secondly you need to find ways to combine those components together effectively without overfitting.    In my opinion both aspects require significant engineering efforts before one could expect any sort of practical benefit out of them.  

However I do believe that if successful then these types of approaches will have great potential because they allow us to leverage decades worth of advances made in computer vision while simultaneously pushing forward our understanding about what makes images look similar/different across different classes. 

Overall I'm very interested in seeing where things go with this line of inquiry!"	1

We have teeth and jaws designed specifically for chewing plant matter, not animal tissue. We also lack the digestive enzymes needed to break down animal protein into amino acids in our stomachs.  This is why we need cooking - heat denatures proteins so they can be broken down by human digestion systems. Humans evolved from primates who ate mostly plants but occasionally hunted small animals like rodents or insects as an extra source of protein.   The earliest known evidence of cooked food dates back about 1 million years ago when early hominids began roasting nuts over open fires.    Because most people don't want their food raw anymore,   this has become one of those things you just do without thinking much about it. Our ancestors were omnivores with diets consisting primarily of fruits, vegetables, seeds, leaves, roots, tubers, invertebrates such as worms, snails, spiders,  scorpions  and other arthropods along with occasional hunting of smaller mammals including rabbits, deer mice, rats, bats, hedgehogs, moles, shrews, voles, gophers, ground hogs, raccoons, opossums, skunks, foxes, coyotes, wolves, bears, cats, dogs, horses, goats, sheep, antelopes, deer;   these foods contain little if any animal protein which means there was no reason to cook them before eating.

At no point during your entire performance is your partner allowed to touch you. You can touch, lick, rub and caress him all you want but play it cool. A slow seduction is a sure recipe for lap dancing success. The whole point of a lap dance is to drive your partner crazy with anticipation and desire.
You are in charge. Take your time, take control, and take pleasure in teasing them.
If they reach out in your direction or starts to grind back, slap their wrist and let them know that if they do it again, the dance is over, no exceptions.;
, You won’t look sexy if you don’t feel sexy. Accept and enjoy yourself regardless of your shape or size. Any woman can perform a great striptease or lap dance regardless of whether they’re shy or feel their body is not the ""perfect shape"". It’s all about attitude. Not all lap dancers have supermodel figures, they just behave like they do. This is your time to be seductive, to nurture and release your sensual spirit. Drop your inhibitions and throw caution to the wind. You are a sexy goddess.

, There’s a wide variety to choose from. From erotic dance-wear to bras, panties, garter-belts, stockings, chemises, robes, teddies, swimsuits, club-wear, fetish-wear, over-sized button-up shirts and so much more. The key is to build up a collection of layers that are easy to remove. Be daring, you’re performing a tease, so a bit of flesh is essential.


Start by selecting underwear first as these items will be the last to come off. A sexy bra, g-string, stockings (stay-ups are easier to work with) and perhaps suspenders.
Panties should frame your cheeks while the back of your panties should reach too high over your cheeks. Try full bottomed panties, thongs, g-strings and booty shorts to see which works best for you. Panties that leave lines on your body after you take them off are probably too tight and should be avoided.
Thigh high stockings worn with or without garters are a sexy addition to almost any outfit. Try a pair that’s one size smaller for sexier movement. If you plan to keep your stockings and garter on for the duration of your dance, wear your panties on the outside of the straps so that they can be removed without having to unhook your garters.
For the top layers, try little hot pants, an innocent sheer robe, sexy high-school teacher/student uniform, be a dominatrix, a desperate housewife or for something different, a classic red or black evening dress with some retro lingerie underneath.
Avoid corsets or clothing that’s too tight and difficult to slip out of. Clothing with zips at the back or many straps that take time to put on will of course be difficult to remove.
For shoes, high heels and stilettos usually work best with any outfit. They make your legs look toned, sleek, and longer. Even if they’re slightly uncomfortable, give them a try because you won’t be wearing them for long anyway. If you can’t walk in heels, rather wear something you’re comfortable in. If all else fails in the shoe department, go barefoot and try the Barefoot Strut.
Remove as much as you are comfortable with. You may choose to end up totally nude, topless, in sexy lingerie, a lacy gown or remain fully clothed. Your lover however must remain fully clothed.
If your choose shoes with buckles, consider how you’ll remove your clothing without taking off your shoes. Stretchy clothing or flowing dresses can be taken off over your shoes, but check first. If all else fails in the shoe department, the bare-foot stripper strut (on your tip toes) is also very hot.
If you’re doing it in heels, don’t take them off (except to remove stockings - or better yet, keep your stockings on). Perhaps put the heels back on once the stockings are off. Strapless shoes can be removed more gracefully than shoes with straps or buckles.
If you chose something that needs to be removed by slipping it over your head, seductively slip it off by pulling it from the bottom on the sides while standing up tall, don't hunch over.
A shirt with buttons can be a very sexy item of clothing to remove. Play peek-a-boob with each side. When you’ve undone the last button, turn around posing at an angle, expose your one shoulder then the other and then let is slip down to the floor.
Tight trousers or jeans can be difficult to remove. A pencil skirt can easily be unzipped and pushed down Do this while bending forward with your back or side to him and then step out of it. Skirts can be removed with your shoes and stockings on.
Practice removing your stockings ahead of time. For extra balance (and teasing), place your toes between his legs or on the arm of his chair while you push each stocking down - or slowly roll or fold them down the length of your leg.
Don’t forget to tease. For beginners, take your time with each layer. Pull your skirt up or your underwear down a few inches before removing. Tuck a thumb or two into the sides of your trousers, skirt or underwear, lower the item of clothing slightly and tease.
Push your bra straps off your shoulders before turning away to unclasp. A classic stripper routine is to hold the bra against your breasts, turn around with your back towards your man and drop your bra on the floor or, when standing with your back to him, hold your bra by the straps above your head before dropping it onto the floor. Keep the heat up by keeping your arm and hand over your breasts then slowly turn around and slide your hand across and away from your breasts for a sexy reveal.
When taking your bottoms off, try slipping them off over your shoes or bare feet while standing straight-legged. Do this by bending over from the waist and guiding them off all the way to the floor and then stepping out of them. If this isn't easy for you, try bending your knees or taking your bottoms off while lying on your back. Don’t squat down too low…
Don’t get completely naked until the very end — and even then, tease him with a back view until he can’t take it anymore.

, Think smooth and seductive. Avoid songs with high pitched vocals. The crooners and divas of the 60s are a good place to start if you want something romantic. A sensual rhythm or beat will guide you through your dance. It's best if you can relate to the music and feel comfortable moving to its beat. Start by setting aside 2 or 3 songs.


Song one is for the warm-up. This is your time to lead your partner to the chair, strut about, pose, explain the rules to your lover and begin to slowly ease into your seductive performance.

, Take your time, start when you're ready, walk around your lover, touch him, drag your fingers through his hair and feel the beat.

, You’re free to decide, short ‘n sweet or long & languishing. You'll probably find yourself deep in the throes of passion by the end of it so consider choosing a dozen songs and enjoy the fun at the end.


If possible, burn all the songs onto a CD or set them as a play-list on your portable music player. Don’t stop to change CDs.

, Close your eyes, feel the music, enter the trance and begin to sway.


Try setting aside 30 minutes or so a day before to get familiar with your clothes, your body, the poses and the moves. Dance on your feet and on the floor. These may be things you’ve never done before. Try sliding down a wall and then back up. Walk around on the tips of your toes.
On the floor, try opening and closing your legs or leaning your knees from one side to the other. Experiment with different angles. Sit on a chair. Caress your thighs, your neck, your belly your feet. Close your legs and then open them using your hands to part your thighs. Re-discover your body. Close your eyes if you’re shy.
If you feel uncomfortable ‘dancing’ think of your performance as a slow aerobics session. Stretch, bend, split. Use your hands, stretch them out to the sides, and stroke your outstretched arm with the tips of your fingers. If you’ve practiced martial arts, yoga or Pilates, modify the posses that you’re familiar with to create your very own sexy moves.
Think of your dance as a T'ai Chi session at the gym. Slow movements and a general sense of well-being.

, Your expression will reflect those sexy thoughts you have in mind and intensify the sexual tension in the air. Look at your body, touch it, enjoy it and then look at your lover drawing his eyes to yours and to your body. Maintain eye contact at all times. If your back is turned to your partner, glance over your shoulder.

, You’re doing this for your pleasure too.


A blindfold will help keep your lover's senses alert - itching to know what will come next.
A pair of handcuffs or a silky scarf can be used to keep your lover’s hands down if he breaks the no touching rule.
Use a soft feather to brush up against your lover’s body or yours. Sit on a chair and while holding your body upright and tall, slide your feet and legs apart and slowly brush yourself from your neck to the inside of your thigh.
If you’re wearing a button up shirt, consider also wearing a tie. Loop it around his neck to pull him closer to your face or cleavage or tie his hands up with it if he breaks the no touching rule.
If you’re the kind of girl that likes to be naughty, have your favorite toy at hand for your pleasure and his torture.
Tease him with a shawl or a silky wrap or use it to cover up if you feel more comfortable being a little less exposed.
Use your hair. While standing up, kneeling, or sitting, stretch your torso while you pull your hair up and let it fall again. Use it to brush up against him.
Use an ice cube from your cocktail. Place a cube in your mouth and run it along your lover's body or brush it across your nipples to set them firm.
Your lips and your eyes are powerful seduction accessories. Try the classic pout or smile. Play with facial expressions.
With a bit of practice, a hat, scarf, cane or rider’s crop can be used in sexually seductive ways.

, Dim the lights, perfume the air and light some candles. Mix candlelight with floor lamps or fairy lights. candlelight adds a soft, warm glow to your body. Indirect lighting is both flattering and more intimate. Avoid fluorescent or white LED lights.


See that your room temperature is comfortable - feeling too cold or too hot will distract you.
Turn off all possible distractions – TV and mobile phones etc.

,


Check that the chair your lover will be sitting on can accommodate the both of you. Sit on it and imagine yourself in his position and then you on his lap.

, The invitation will set his mind alight and prolong the torture across an entire day. Alternatively, spring it on him as a surprise. Either way, you’ll need to spend a some time setting the scene and calming your nerves if it’s your first time.

, Have him sit with his legs closed. Start by staring him straight in the eye with a teasing smile on your face. Walk around your lover, touch him, drag your fingers through his hair and feel the beat. Strut about, pose, explain the rules to your lover and begin to slowly ease into your seductive performance.

, Run your fingers through your hair, down your neck, your chest then down to your hips and around your butt. As you move your hands across your body imagine your hands are his hands. Enjoy the touch of your (his) hands on your body. Keeping your hands in contact with your body let them ride up your sides and back towards the nape of your neck. Look him in the eye and try a slow and gentle head roll (head falls forward and then rolls back up), letting your hair fall at the same time.

, Move towards him so your crotch is almost against his knee then lean in like you're going to kiss him for just long enough that he can smell your perfume then pull away.

, Think sexy and feel sexy. Begin moving your hips to the music in a soft circular motion. Close your eyes for a few seconds and enjoy the moment. There's no-one around, just you and your lover. Take your time, then, slowly step towards your partner, one foot in front of the other, cat-walk style. When you're near enough, take your lap dance to the next level.

, Turn around and position yourself between your lover’s legs. Bend down to sit on his lap and grind your bottom slowly (and gently) into his lap.

, Top first...Seductively and gradually remove another item or two of clothing (perhaps your skirt or hot-pants) then move back towards your partner again. Get so close you'll practically be sitting on your lover's lap. Sensually lean in towards your lover's ear breathing your hot breath over it, let out a soft aching moan. Softly nibble or brush against his neck, breathing your lover in as if you were getting high off their scent.

, Keep eye contact and keep caressing yourself from different angles and perspectives. Move into the crawl and then mount him again for another grinding session.

, Move away for brief moments. Remember that eye contact is very important. Let your eyes transmit all those sexy thoughts and don’t forget to smile.

, Then move on to another part of the house or go for a walk. You may have to run...

, The possibilities are endless and the results are always great.

, He will love that!

, Make sure to use condoms though!

"The paper proposes to enhance the attention mechanism for sentiment classification by using global context computed by a Bi-LSTM. The proposed models outperform many existing models in the literature on 3 sentiment analysis datasets. 

The key idea of using Bi-LSTM to compute global context for attention is actually not novel, as proposed several times in the literature, e.g., Luong et al (2015) and Shen & Lee (2016). Especially, Luong et al (2015) already proposed to combine global context with local context for attention.

Regarding to the experiments, of course it would be nice if the model can work well without the need of tricks like dropout or pre-trained word embeddings. However, it would be even better if the model can work well using those tricks. The authors should show results of the models using those tricks and compare them to the results in the literature.

"Bleaching shorts with hydrogen peroxide will give it a faded, worn-out look.  This technique works best when used over light-colored shorts like white ones.   Hydrogen peroxide (also known as water oxigen) comes from natural sources such as plants and animals.

The cosmic code comparison project is an effort to compare the results produced by different cosmological codes, and thereby test their accuracy.  The goal is to produce a set of simulated data that can be used as input for any number of codes, and then have each code run on this same dataset.   This will allow us to determine how well these codes agree with one another in terms of both the physical quantities they predict (e.g., matter density profiles) and also the statistical properties of those predictions (e.g., power spectra).   We are currently working towards producing a large suite of simulations covering a wide range of parameter space, including dark energy models, modified gravity theories, neutrino masses, and primordial non-Gaussianity. In addition we plan to make available a variety of observational datasets which can be compared against the simulation outputs using standard techniques such as cross-correlation functions or likelihood analysis. The cosmic code comparison project is funded through NASA's Astrophysics Theory Program under grant NNX09AC84G.	1

The banks are closed on weekends and holidays so there is no one to handle transactions electronically. The only way you can get your money out of an account at these times would be by going into the branch location in person with identification (ID) that matches what was used when opening up the account. Some accounts may have online banking available 24/7 but this will depend upon which type of account it is as well as how much money has been deposited/withdrawn from said account within any given time period. For example if someone deposits $500 cash into their checking account they won't be able to withdraw all 500 dollars until Monday morning because the transaction requires approval before being completed. This also applies to debit cards where the amount withdrawn must match exactly what was paid in using the card. There isn't anyone around who knows about the deposit made over the weekend unless it's done through direct deposit. In addition many people don't check their bank balances while away from home	1
"With great difficulty over the better part of a century.

The Great Trigonometrical Survey of India started from the ocean in 1802, and 100 feet at a time, took measurements and did a bunch of math, and worked there way across the sub-continent to the Himalayas, completing in 1871.

It was a great scientific achievement, lead during some of its more important years by George Everest, who received a knighthood for his efforts.

The basic technique is fairly simple. You start with two sticks at sea level, a decent distance apart, and measure their exact longitude and latitude. Then you put a third stick some distance away and inland, making a triangle. Based on the distance between the first two sticks and the angles they form with the third stick, you can compute the third stick's exact position and elevation.
Once all that is done, you repeat, planting a stick further inland and drawing a new triangle. 

The Great Survey did this with better instruments, better technique, and on a greater scale than had ever been done before."	0
"  We report on detections of the high-excitation CO J=6-5, J=4-3 lines in
Mrk231, a prototypical Ultra Luminous Infrared Galaxy (ULIRG) and Seyfert 1
QSO. These observations are combined with CO J=3-2, HCN J=4-3 (this work), and
CO J=2-1, J=1-0, 13CO J=2-1, HCN J=1-0 measurements taken from the literature
to provide better constraints on the properties of the molecular gas in an
extreme starburst/QSO in the local Universe. We find that the CO J=4-3 and
J=6-5 transitions trace a different gas phase from that dominating the lower
three CO transitions, with n(H_2) ~ (1-3)x10^4 cm-3 and Tk ~ (40-70) K. This
phase is responsible for the luminous HCN emission, and contains most of the H2
gas mass of this galaxy. The total CO line cooling emanating from this dense
phase is found similar to that of the [CII] line at 158 micron, suggesting a
very different thermal balance to that seen in lower IR-luminosity galaxies,
and one likely dominated by dense photon-dominated regions. Our dense
""sampling"" of the CO rotational ladder and the HCN lines enables us to produce
well-constrained Spectral Line Energy Distributions (SLEDs) for the dense
molecular gas in Mrk231 and compare them to those of high redshift starbursts,
many of which have SLEDs that may be affected by strong lensing. Finally, we
use our local molecular line excitation template to assess the capabilities of
future cm and mm/sub-mm arrays in detecting CO and HCN transitions in similar
systems throughout the local and distant universe.

We study the problem of finding an explicit formula for the dimension of the space spanned by all vectors in a given finite set $S$ whose Schatten $p$-norms are bounded above by some constant $C$, where $1<p<\infty$ is fixed and $p>2$.  We show that this dimension can be expressed as a polynomial in $C^{1/p}$ (and hence also in the cardinality of $S$) if we assume that $S$ has no two elements which are orthogonal under any inner product on $\mathbb{C}^n$.   This result generalizes earlier results obtained independently by M. Lustig and A. Shub and by J. Bourgain and G. Bouschler. It should be noted that our proof does not use the fact that the underlying field is complex; it works over arbitrary fields of characteristic zero. The main ingredient of our argument is a new combinatorial identity involving binomial coefficients.	1

"One way of thinking about the way languages are constructed is by saying that all statements in every language have a subject (the person or thing doing an action), the object (the thing being acted upon) and the verb (the action being taken).

English has what's called an ""SVO"" sentence order, for subject-verb-object. So in the sentence **The cat eats the mouse**, ""The cat"" is the subject, ""the mouse"" is the object, and ""eats"" is the verb.

 If we change that order around, we either have a totally different sentence like **The mouse eats the cat** (where ""the mouse"" is now assumed to be the subject because it comes first), or we have something that doesn't make any sense, like **Eat the mouse the cat.**

However, there's no particular reason why languages have to be organized this way. In fact, this isn't even the most common worldwide. Languages like Japanese and Hindi are ""SOV"" order, so directly translated their sentences are something like **The cat the mouse eats.**

It's actually a bit more complex than this--a lot of languages have flexible sentence order, because you can use different endings or small words to mark which parts of the sentence are which, and then you can arrange them any way you want. For example, in latin, you could write **Fēlēs murem cōnsūmit** or **Murem fēlēs cōnsūmit**, and both mean ""The cat eats the mouse,"" since the way you end the words for ""mouse"" and ""cat"" tell you whether it's supposed to be the subject or the object.

Fun side fact: the rarest of all possible sentence orders is OSV, where you put the object before the subject and the verb at the end. There are very, very few languages on earth that use it, and most are isolated tribal languages in the amazon. However, when you hear it, it sounds familiar and pretty understandable. Why? Well, because with this sentence order Yoda speaks!"	0
"The first step towards understanding how computations can help us understand chemistry better involves learning about some of the various computational techniques that have been developed over time.  These include quantum mechanical methods like density functional theory (DFT), semiempirical methods like AM1, PM3 etc. , force fields , Monte Carlo simulations  and molecular dynamics .
Quantum Mechanical Methods

Density Functional Theory(DFT)
In DFT one starts from the Schrödinger equation:
$$ H |\psi\rangle = E |\psi \rangle $$ 
where $|\psi\rangle$ represents wave function of the system under consideration . This equation has no closed form analytic solution except when dealing with very small molecules e.g Hydrogen Atom. 
However it does provide useful information regarding ground state properties of many... Quantum mechanics describes matter at atomic level using concepts such as particles called fermions - neutrons,... How do you learn more? Click here! 
 
 
 
 Semi Empirical Methods:
These methods use experimental data alongwith ab initio results to predict physical parameters of large number of molecules accurately within reasonable amount of computer resources available today.   They are based upon fitting calculated values against experimentally determined ones so they tend to work best if there exists sufficient experimental data for comparison purposes.

The Maltese breed has been popular since ancient times.  It was originally bred in Malta where it lived alongside fishermen who kept them close because of their small size.   They were also kept by wealthy Romans.    In fact, there are many paintings depicting Maltese dogs from Roman times through the Renaissance period.   Today they remain one of America's most beloved breeds.   This guide will help you learn how best to take care of these wonderful little dogs.   If you're considering adopting an older Maltese, read How To Adopt An Older Pet before proceeding.     Before buying a Maltese consider carefully if it's really what...   You may want to check out other types of dogs first such as:  Toy Poodles     Chihuahua    Miniature Schnauzers     Yorkshire Terriers     Cavalier King Charles Spaniels     Shih Tzus     Bichons Frise     Pomeranian     Coton de Tulear     Lhasa Apso     Beagle     Boxer     Boston Terrier     Golden Retriever     Labrador Retriever     German Shepherd     Rottweiler     Greyhound     Border Collie     Australian Shepherd     Staffordshire Bull Terrier     Welsh Corgi     Cairns Terrier     Aussiepoo     Cockapoo     Morkie     Yorkipoo     Maltese are very active and energetic dogs which need lots of exercise every day.

"  We have used the ACS camera on HST to obtain (V,I) photometry for 5300
red-giant stars in the halo of the dominant Leo-group member NGC 3379, a galaxy
usually regarded as a classic normal giant elliptical. We use this sample of
stars to derive the metallicity distribution function (MDF) for its outer-halo
field stars 33 kpc from the galaxy center. The MDF is distinctly unlike all the
other E galaxies for which we have similar data (including the Local Group
dwarf ellipticals, the intermediate-luminosity NGC 3377, and the giant NGC
5128). First, the MDF for the NGC 3379 outer halo is broad and flat, with many
stars at every interval in [m/H]. Second, we see a metallicity gradient across
our ACS field such that in its outermost region the blue, low-metallicity stars
([m/H] < -0.7) are beginning to dominate and the higher-metallicity stars are
rapidly diminishing. Our target field is centered at a projected distance about
equal to 12 R_e, twice as far out in units of effective radius as in any of the
other galaxies that we have surveyed. If NGC 3379 is indeed representative of
large E/S0 galaxies, we predict that such galaxies in general will reveal
diffuse low-metallicity subpopulations, but that photometry at radii r ~ 10 -
15 R_e will be necessary to see the faint low-metallicity component clearly.

Paper summary: this work presents ENet, a new convnet architecture for semantic labeling which obtains comparable performance to the previously existing SegNet while being ~10x faster and using ~10x less memory. 


Review summary: Albeit the results seem interesting, the paper lacks detailed experimental results, and is of limited interest for the ICLR audience.


Pros:
* 10x faster
* 10x smaller
* Design rationale described in detail


Cons:
* The quality of the reference baseline is low. For instance, cityscapes results are 58.3 IoU while state of the art is ~80 IoU. Thus the results are of limited interest.
* The results that support the design rationale are not provided. It is important to provide the experimental evidence to support each claim.


Quality: the work is interesting but feels incomplete. If your model is 10x faster and smaller, why not try build a model 10x longer to obtain improved results ? The paper focuses only on  nimbleness at the cost of quality (using a weak baseline). This limits the interest for the ICLR audience.


Clarity: the overall text is somewhat clear, but the model description (section 3) could be more clear. 


Originality: the work is a compendium of “practitioners wisdom” applied to a specific task. It has thus limited originality.


Significance: I find the work that establishes a new “best practices all in one” quite interesting, but however these must shine in all aspects. Being fast at the cost of quality, will limit the impact of this work.


Minor comments:
* Overall the text is proper english but the sentences constructions is often unsound, specific examples below. 
* To improve the chances of acceptance, I invite the authors to also explore bigger models and show that the same “collected wisdom” can be used both to reach high speed and high quality (with the proper trade-off curve being shown). Aiming for only one end of the quality versus speed curve limits too much the paper.
* Section 1: “mobile or battery powered … require rates > 10 fps“. 10 fps with which energy budget ? Should not this be  > 10 fps && < X Watt.
* “Rules and ideas” -> rules seem too strong of a word, “guidelines” ?
* “Is of utmost importance” -> “is of importance” (important is already important)
* “Presents a trainable network … therefore we compare to … the large majority of inference the same way”; the sentence makes no sense to me, I do not see the logical link between before and after “therefore”
* Scen-parsing -> scene-parsing
* It is arguable if encoder and decoder can be called “separate”
* “Unlike in Noh” why is that relevant ? Make explicit or remove
* “Real-time” is vague, you mean X fps @ Y W ?
* Other existing architectures -> Other architectures
* Section 3, does not the BN layer include a bias term ? Can you get good results without any bias term ?
* Table 1: why is the initial layer a downsampling one, since the results has half the size of the input ?
* Section 4, non linear operations. What do you mean by “settle to recurring pattern” ?
* Section 4, dimensionality changes. “Computationally expensive”, relative to what ?
* Section 4, dimensionality changes. “This technique ... speeds-up ten times”, but does not provide the same results. Without an experimental validation changing an apple for an orange does not make the orange better than the apple.
* Section 4, dimensionality changes. “Found one problem”, problem would imply something conceptually wrong. This is more an “issue” or an “miss-match” when using ResNet for semantic labelling.
* Section 4, factorizing filters. I am unsure of why you call nx1 filter asymmetric. A filter could be 1xn yet be symmetric (e.g. -2 -1 0 1 2). Why not simply call them rectangular filters ?
* Section 4, factorizing filters. Why would this change increase the variety ? I would have expected the opposite.
* Section 4, regularization. Define “much better”.
* Section 5.1; “640x360 is adequate for practical applications”; for _some_ applications.
* Section 5.2, “very quickly” is vague and depends on the reader expectations, please be quantitative.
* Section 5.2, Haver -> have
* Section 5.2, in this work -> In this work
* Section 5.2, unclear what you use the class weighting for. Is this for class balancing ?
* Section 5.2, Cityscapes was -> Cityscapes is
* Section 5.2, weighted by the average -> is each instance weighted relative the average object size.
* Section 5.2, fastest model in the Cityscapes -> fastest model in the public Cityscapes"	0
"Anesthesiologist here.

There are two broad categories of general anesthetics, which are divided based on how they are administered: intravenous and inhalational.

Let's start with intravenous. The most common IV general anesthetic is Propofol by far. Propofol is the milky white drug you sometimes see on medical shows. You may know of it as the ""Michael Jackson Drug"". Us anesthesiologists sometimes refer to it as ""Milk of Amnesia"" (or maybe that's just me). The induction dose (the slug we give you at the start to put you to sleep) is calculated based on body weight. Typically around 2 milligrams per kilogram of body weight. For the super obese patients we use an adjusted value that's somewhere between their actual body weight and their ""ideal body weight"". Younger patients, alcoholics, and red heads will need more milligrams per kilogram. Older patients, and those with certain neurological or medical issues, or those under the influence of certain drugs (medical or recreational) will need less.

After I determine you are unconscious, I will stick a breathing tube down your throat, hook it up to my anesthesia machine, and dial in the inhalational agent. In terms of inhalational agents, the three most common ones are Sevoflurane, Desflurane, and Nitrous Oxide. These agents are not dosed by milligrams, but by concentration in percents. We measure the percent concentration of the agent in the exhaled breath. Sevoflurane is dosed to about 2%, Desflurane 6-8%. The remainder percent is typically a mixture of pure oxygen and medical air. Nitrous Oxide by itself would not be sufficient to keep you under general anesthesia (it would require  > 100%!), so if we use it, we usually use it to ""cut"" either the Sevo or the Desflurane (i.e. 50/50 O2/Nitrous plus 1% Sevo). Each agent has its unique advantages and disadvantages, and I use many factors to determine which agent is best for you.

How do they work? Big picture wise, they decrease the activity of excitatory circuits in the central nervous system and increase the activity of inhibitory circuits in the same (particularly that of a chemical called GABA). They suppress your sympathetic nervous system as well, which may reduce your blood pressure and/or heart rate."	0
"  The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has been instrumental in the discovery of
large numbers of extragalactic young massive star clusters (YMCs), often
assumed to be proto-globular clusters (GCs). As a consequence, the field of YMC
formation and evolution is thriving, generating major breakthroughs as well as
controversies on annual (or shorter) time-scales. Here, I review the long-term
survival chances of YMCs, hallmarks of intense starburst episodes often
associated with violent galaxy interactions. In the absence of significant
external perturbations, the key factor determining a cluster's long-term
survival chances is the shape of its stellar initial mass function (IMF). It
is, however, not straightforward to assess the IMF shape in unresolved
extragalactic YMCs. I also discuss the latest progress in worldwide efforts to
better understand the evolution of entire cluster populations, predominantly
based on HST observations, and conclude that there is an increasing body of
evidence that GC formation appears to be continuing until today; their
long-term evolution crucially depends on their environmental conditions,
however.

;
, The four roles are Controller, Defender, Leader, and Striker.


Controllers deal damage to multiple enemies and prefer offense over defense. Controller classes include Druids, Invokers, and Wizards.
Defenders are front-line combatants and have high defense. Defender classes include Fighters, Paladins, and Wardens.
Leaders have healing and aiding abilities to protect the rest of the party as their roll, and also boast high defense. Leader classes include Bards, Clerics, Shamans, and Warlords.
Strikers deal massive damage to single enemies at a time and have the highest attack and mobility of the party. Striker classes include Avengers, Barbarians, Rangers, Rogues, Sorcerers, and Warlocks.

, You should consult their descriptions in the source books in making this decision.


The PHB contains information on the classes Cleric, Fighter, Paladin, Ranger, Rogue, Warlock, Warlord, and Wizard.
The PHB2 contains information on the classes Avenger, Barbarian, Bard, Druid, Invoker, Shaman, Sorcerer, and Warden.
The PHB3 contains information on the classes Ardent, Battlemind, Monk, Psion, Runepriest, and Seeker.

, Also create a vertical column with six lines title stats. At the beginning of each line, write down the following: Strength (Str), Constitution (Con), Dexterity (Dex), Intelligence (Int), Wisdom (Wis), and Charisma (Cha). These make up the six ability scores of your character. ]]


Strength represents physical power.
Constitution represents health and stamina.
Dexterity represents agility and reflexes.
Intelligence represents reasoning.
Wisdom represents common sense.
Charisma represents personality.

, Ability scores are the base statistics for your character and can be determined with one of three methods. Note that each class depends on certain ability scores, which typically means that you should assign higher scores to these abilities.


The first method uses a standard array of scores. Assign the following numbers to each ability score any way you like: 16, 14, 13, 12, 11, and 10.
The second method is a little more complicated. Start with the following scores: 8, 10, 10, 10, 10, and 10. You have 22 ""points"" to spend in order to increase the ability scores. Use the following rules to spend these points and improve your ability scores, then assign the score to the specific abilities.

Improving the numbers 8-12 costs one point. As such, increasing the ""8"" to a ""12"" would cost 4 points. Improving a ""10"" to a ""13"" would cost only 3: one point each for 10-to-11, 11-to-12, and 12-to-13.
Improving the numbers 13-15 costs two points. As such, increasing the ""12"" from before would cost another point to become a ""13"", but an additional two points to improve to a ""14"". Similarly, improving the ""13"" to a ""16"" would cost 6 points: two each for 13-to-14, 14-to-15, and 15-to-16.
Improving a ""16"" to a ""17"" costs another three points.
Improving a ""17"" to an ""18"" costs another four points. As a result, upgrading a ""10"" to an ""18"" would cost a total of 16 points = 3*1 + 3*2 + 3 + 4.


The third method uses randomly-generated numbers and provides the most versatile and volatile scores. For each ability score, roll 4 6-sided dice (4d6). Add the three highest numbers, ignore the lowest, and assign the sum as an ability score.

,


Add or subtract these from the base stats. Once the base stats have been assigned after racial adjustments, assign each score an ability modifier, with either a plus or minus sign next to the base stat followed by the number. The table shows the ability modifiers:

Ad infinitum. At first level, 8 should be the lowest ability score and 18 the highest. Average scores are considered between 12-16.



, In the PHB, a list of skills to choose from can be found in chapter five. First, go to your classes' entry in the PHB in chapter four.

, These skills are the skills you are trained in, and each get a permanent +5 bonus.

, They can be found on page 178 of the PHB.

, Next to each skill ability, write down the skill points you currently have. Each skill point is equal to one-half of your level plus your ability score modifier and +5 if you are trained in that skill.


As an example, say you are playing a 1st-level human rogue with the following ability scores:

str 11 +0
con 10 +0
dex 16 +3
int 12 +1
wis 8 -1
cha 14 +2

A rogue is automatically trained in Thievery and Stealth, meaning he or she gets an automatic +5 points for both of those skills. They can also choose four of the following skills to be trained in:

Acrobatics, Athletics, Bluff, Dungeoneering, Insight, Intimidate, Perception, and Streetwise.
As an example, Acrobatics, Bluff, Perception, and Streetwise were chosen to be trained skills. This means that the rogue currently has six skills he or she is trained in and has a permanent +5 bonus to. Since Acrobatics is a dexterity-based skill, the dexterity modifier of the rogue is added to the score, which is +3 in this case. Acrobatics is now equal to 8 total skill points.







,, At first level, you may choose one feat from chapter six. If you are human, you gain an additional feat. Feats provide static bonuses to characters, and bonuses of the same type do not stack together.

, If you do, you may choose the feat If you don't, you must wait until you meet the prerequisite.

, Powers are different kinds of attack your character can make and are divided into four categories: At-Will, Encounter, Daily, and Utility powers. ""At-Will"" powers can be used once per turn in an encounter indefinitely. ""Encounter"" powers can be used once per combat encounter. ""Daily"" powers can be used once per day.


Utility powers act like feats in that they give you static bonuses and certain advantages.
Each class in both the PHB and PHB2 list their powers in the same chapter. However, additional 4th edition d&d books are available for an extended list of available powers. The Martial Power handbook provides more

, The Arcane Power handbook provides more powers for arcane characters. The Primal Power handbook provides more powers for primal characters. The Martial Power Handbook provides more power to martial characters.


At first level, each player can choose 2 at-wills, 1 encounter, and 1 daily powers. You can choose 1 utility power at second level.

, At first level, you start with 100 gold pieces(gp) to spend on equipment. Chapter in the PHB provides you with a list of equipment to choose from. Purchase armor and weapons first, and then basic adventuring supplies. It's up to the party who carries what, unless you purchased all of your equipment on your own. Once these things are purchased, if you have any money left over you can choose to spend it on magic items, also found in chapter 7 in the PHB. The Adventurer's Vault Handbook provides an extension of supplies you can choose from as well.

, It is highly recommended you use a character sheet to record your player info, but it is not necessary. Regular paper can work as well.

Lawful Good means you follow the rules and do good.
Good means you do good, but does not necessarily mean you follow rules.
Chaotic Evil is ultimate evil. You can do anything you want if it is evil.
Evil means that you do evil, but you should follow rules.

, Initiative determines who goes in what order in a combat. Your initiative bonus is equal to one-half your level plus your dexterity modifier, and any bonuses or penalties that apply from armor or feats.

, Each of these defenses are equal to 10 plus one-half of your level plus the appropriate ability modifier. For armor class, add your armor bonus if any, and if you wear light armor add either your dex or int modifier, whichever of the two is higher. Fortitude uses the Str or Con modifier, Reflex uses the Dex or Int modifier, and Will uses the Wis or Cha modifier, whichever of the two is higher. If your class or race has any bonuses to these defenses, add them.

, Speed is determined by your character's race.

,, Passive perception and passive insight are the two most common passive senses. You have +10 in passive perception and passive insight at first level.

, Attack bonuses are equal to one-half your level plus your attack's ability score modifier plus any class bonuses plus any proficiencies with a weapon plus any feats plus any weapon enhancements. An attack bonus, also known as a to-hit bonus, is added onto a d20 roll whenever you make a specific attack.

, Your hit points are determined by your class. Your bloodied value is equal to half of your hit points. Your healing surges per day are determined by your class. Your healing surge value is equal to one-fourth of your total hit points.

"Helium has no atoms that are bound together by chemical bonds to form larger structures like liquids or solids do; it only exists as individual gas particles called ""atoms"" and these don't have any kinetic energy even when they move very fast so there isn't anything keeping them from freezing into an immobile state of matter known as solid ice. Helium doesn't freeze because its atoms aren't held in place with strong enough forces between each other to prevent this process occurring. The same thing happens on Earth but we can't see it; it's too slow compared to our perception time frame. It takes billions of years before you would notice something had changed physically. This means that although helium may appear to be frozen under normal conditions, it will still exist as a gas until heated up above -273 degrees Celsius/-423 degrees Fahrenheit. Because it does not contain large amounts of heat which could cause it to melt back down again once melted"	1
It takes time and effort to make it properly, which makes it more costly than other types of meat products that are mass produced in factories. It also requires special equipment like dehydrators or ovens with low temperatures settings. The process can take up to 24 hours per batch depending on how thickly cut you want your jerky strips to be.  This means it's not as easy to produce large amounts at once compared to factory made meats such as hot dogs or sausages. It's usually sold by weight rather than volume because its density varies greatly based upon the amount of water removed during processing. Because there isn't much demand for this type of product outside of certain areas where people hunt wild game (like Alaska), most commercial producers sell their goods online through websites instead of having stores open to customers who live nearby. There aren't many retailers selling beef jerky locally due to high production costs associated with making it	1
"A Hole in the Sock of Dave Davies refers to an unreleased album of solo material by Dave Davies, lead guitarist and co-founder of British rock band the Kinks. Apparently the album was, at least for a time, intended to be released under the name Lincoln County, however, numerous names have been applied to it, including The Album That Never Was.

Background
In July 1967, Dave Davies readied his first solo single, credited entirely under his name (although co-written by his brother and fellow Kinks member Ray Davies), entitled ""Death of a Clown"". In the past, as a member of the Kinks, Dave Davies had only released his own compositions on B-sides and as part of larger LPs. The Kinks' record label sensed potential sales in a solo release from the overlooked Davies, and issued ""Death of a Clown"" as his debut. Although credited to Davies, it was technically a Kinks recording, as his backing band was, in fact, the Kinks.

Upon release, ""Death of a Clown"" unexpectedly rose to number three on the UK Singles Chart. Wanting to profit off the new buzz that was suddenly surrounding Davies, a solo LP was scheduled for release some time in 1968 or 1969.

A follow-up single, ""Susannah's Still Alive"", was released in November 1967. However, it only reached number 20 on Melody Maker. The release of the solo album was held back, and it was decided to wait and see how another single would fare. As anticipation grew for the release of the new LP, fans nicknamed it A Hole in the Sock Of. The name was based on a remark Ray Davies had made to a reporter during an interview about the title of Dave's forthcoming solo album and was, although meant ironically, taken seriously. The title was a send up possibly of the Beatles ambitious ""A Day in the Life"" or Traffic's ""Hole In My Shoe"".

""Lincoln County"" was chosen as the next single but failed to chart. With subsequent singles meeting the same result, a combination of Davies' own lack of interest in continuing and Pye's decision to stop killed off any hopes of an album.

In a 1999 interview, Davies stated that:

I was quite surprised when management and the record company wanted me to make an album. I thought it was quite daunting. There were a couple of tunes I liked - 'Suzannah's Still Alive,' 'Lincoln County' - but it had to feel right, and it didn't feel right. I did a few songs in a demo studio and I knocked out three or four songs, and one of them was 'Creeping Jean,' and I started to get very depressed about the whole idea. One of the last songs I recorded then was 'I'm Crying,' so you can tell what frame of mind I was in.

Recording and tracks
Technically work began on the project after the unexpected success of ""Death of a Clown"". Initially, proposed material included blues numbers by Lead Belly and Big Bill Broonzy in addition to original material; ultimately, lack of both original material and interest delayed further work on an LP until the very end of 1968, when four new songs were recorded at Polydor Studios in London. Work was to have completed early in 1969 but was delayed at least partly when Dave Davies fractured a finger. Much of the unissued material seems to have been recorded in June 1969, just after completion of recordings for Arthur (with John Dalton, not Pete Quaife, on bass). Two titles (""This Man He Weeps Tonight"" and ""Mindless Child of Motherhood""), both released as B-sides of Kinks singles were recorded as part of the Arthur sessions, but ultimately not included on that LP's final track selection. 

Reprise files imply that Reprise received tapes of this album, under the title Lincoln County, in July 1969 while it was still considered for release by the band. By September of that year, the decision was made not to release the album. Throughout 1970, reports of a reworked version with new material were discussed; the possibility of issuing Dave's LP as the second half of a 2-LP set was raised, but by the close of that year all talk of the LP's release had ceased. Oddly, tapes of this LP were not officially logged into Reprise's official master tape log until 1972, as part of their contractual settlement after the Kinks moved to RCA. Short of the existence of this acetate in their vaults, there is no other indication that Reprise ever seriously considered this LP for release in its entirety. All songs were mixed (in the case of ""Susannah's Still Alive"", remixed) in stereo for this release. The track listing given here is per Doug Hinman.

The Album That Never Was
Although the unreleased album is sometimes called The Album That Never Was, several other unreleased Kinks projects were called this over time. A compilation of Dave Davies' solo singles and B-sides was released under this title in 1987, and included ""This Man He Weeps Tonight"". In the version released in Japan, ""Mr. Shoemakers Daughter"" can also be found.

" One of the most common, important uses of hyphens is to string together related words and concepts to form single words and unified phrases. For example, terms like ""state-of-the-art"", ""first-timer"", and ""penny-pincher"" all use hyphens to create a single idea from multiple words.


Here are a few examples of hyphens being used correctly in compound words:

The singer was infamous for his over-reliance on autotune.


That ten-year-old is remarkably mature for her age.


As a general rule, you should never put spaces around a hyphen (e.g., write ""ten-year-old"", not ""ten - year - old."";
, Most words with prefixes, like ""predetermined"" and ""evermore"" don't need hyphens. However, some prefixes (namely, ""ex-"", ""self-"", ""all-"", and sometimes ""cross-"") need hyphens to separate them from the word they're modifying. Note that ""cross"" doesn't need to be hyphenated in words like ""crossword,"" where it is part of the word itself, nor in terms like ""cross purposes,"" where it is a separate word, as it's not being used as a prefix in these cases.


Here is an example of a hyphen being used for prefixes:

She frequently accused her ex-boyfriend of being completely self-absorbed.



, Similar to the way they are used for compound words, hyphens can also be used to create descriptive, colorful terms that may not be found in the dictionary. Hyphens used in this way allow you to create your own words from scratch. However, it's important to remember not to rely too heavily on unique hyphenated words, as this can become distracting. If you can convey your ideas just as well with one or more normal words, do so.


Here is an example of a unique hyphenated word used well:

Kim took time off from her job and became a professional couch-sitter in the days just before giving birth.


Here is an example of a unique hyphenated word being used in a way that's not necessary. In this case, the hyphens don't make the term any easier to understand.

I couldn't decide what to get at the pizza place, so I ordered my usual three-cheese-no-meat combo.



, Some words are hyphenated when neglecting the hyphen would make the meaning of the word unclear. For instance, to convey the idea of a duplicate or replica, a writer may use the word ""re-creation"" in place of ""recreation"" because the latter can also mean ""fun"" or ""entertainment"". Hyphens can also be used in a similar way to make compound words more visually appealing in cases where the first word ends with the same letter that the second starts with.


Here are a few examples of hyphens used for clarity. In the first, ""re-signed"" has a different meaning than ""resigned"" and ""foreign-film theater"" has a less ambiguous meaning than ""foreign film theater"". In the second, the hyphen separates the first ""e"" from the second.

Jeremy re-signed his contract, then took the train to the foreign-film theater to celebrate.


After the convicts passed a compulsory period of good behavior, the re-education program began in earnest.



, Though the rules for when to use numerals and when to spell out numbers can vary from style guide to style guide, many grammatical sources will recommend using a hyphen for two-word numbers below one hundred. In other words, use hyphens for the numbers twenty-one through ninety-nine, with the exceptions of thirty, forty, fifty, etc. This also means that after one hundred, you'll still use hyphens between the numbers in the ""tens"" and ""ones"" places (e.g. ""two hundred twenty-two"").


Here is an example of correct number hyphenation:

The wedding reception had eighty-eight guests, but the cooks only prepared seventy-nine entrees.



, When writing fractions out as words, rather than writing them as numerals, you should separate the two numbers in the fraction with a hyphen. This rule is true even for mixed fractions (fractions preceded by a whole number, like ""three and five-sixths"").


Here is an example of hyphens used correctly in two fractions:

The snickerdoodle recipe calls for two and two-thirds cups of flour and two and one-quarter cups of sugar.



, When someone has two last names (usually because his or her parents kept their own last names after marriage), the names are hyphenated. In rare cases where someone has three or more last names, all of the names are hyphenated.


Here is an example of hyphens used correctly for last names:

When Suzie Sanders-Johnson and Tim Rodriguez-Lyle had their first child, they weren't sure what his last name would be.



, In cases where a sentence calls for a list of hyphenated words or numbers that share a common word, it's usually OK to write the word only for the last item in the list. For the other items in the list, write the word or number followed by a hyphen. Separate each item with a comma as you normally would in a list.


Here is an example of hyphens used in a list:

For this construction project, we're going to need plenty of ten-, twenty-, and fifty-inch boards.



, If you're ever unsure of when (or when not) to use a hyphen, consult a reference source for guidance. A wide variety of grammar references are available both in print, in libraries or book stores, and online. Be sure to choose a reference source that's well-qualified and professional. It's hard to go wrong with the ""big three"" style guides: APA Style, MLA Style, and Chicago/Turabian Style.


Note that minor differences may exist between the style guides you consult. For instance, the MLA style guide allows you to use hyphens for expressing number ranges (e.g., 350-400 degrees), while the Chicago style guide recommends an en dash., Some words which are technically compound words have become so commonplace and well-known that hyphenating them can actually make their meaning less clear. For example, ""lunchtime"" and ""roommate"" don't need to be hyphenated, as these common words' meanings are perfectly clear without hyphens. Note that in some cases, hyphens are optional: both ""high school"" and ""high-school"" are generally considered acceptable.


Here is an example of compound words that don't need hyphens:

I will read you a story at bedtime, but only if you correct the misprints in your book report .



, As noted above, except in some exceptional cases, most words with prefixes don't need hyphens and will look cumbersome if an unnecessary hyphen is added. There are too many of these ""normal"" prefixes that don't require a hyphen to list, but here are just a few: ""pre-"", ""post-"", ""non-"", ""un-"", ""anti-"", ""re-"", ""bi-"", ""di-"", and ""de-"".Here is an example of words with prefixes that don't need hyphens:

The recycled paper was strangely unaffected by the heat of the fire.



, When a compound word or phrase can be used as both a verb and a noun or adjective, you generally shouldn't include a hyphen if the word is used as a verb. For instance, the term ""back up"" can be used as a verb and a noun to mean both ""to make a copy of something for safekeeping"" and ""a copy of something"", respectively. Thus, you would write ""back up"" as a verb like this: ""Please back up your hard disk data,"" and write it as a noun like this: ""He is our back-up plan if the other candidate doesn't want the job.""


Here is an example of a verb that doesn't need a hyphen:

Tell the repairman to fix it.


However, the same phrase can use a hyphen when it becomes an adjective:

Call our usual fix-it guy, please.



, Some words, like ""today"" and ""tonight"", were once hyphenated like normal compound words. This is generally not done in modern writing, so you shouldn't feel any need to include these superfluous hyphens unless you're specifically trying to mimic an old-fashioned tone or style.


Here is an example of words that once used hyphens but do not today:

I shall meet you tomorrow at sunup when the cock crows and not one moment sooner.



, Though hyphens are used to construct many compound words and phrases, you shouldn't use them after adverbs that end with ""-ly"", like ""softly"", ""strongly"", and ""deftly"", and after the word ""very"" when it's used as an adverb. Note, however, that you can use hyphens after words that end with ""-ly"" if they aren't adverbs, like ""family"", ""barely"", and so on. As a reminder, adverbs are words that modify or qualify a verb, adjective, or another adverb.Here is an example of adverbs that don't need a hyphen:

The quickly drying paint was bone dry within the hour.


Note that hyphens can be used correctly after a word ending in ""-ly"" that is not an adverb:

The little boy reached toward the friendly-looking rabbit without fear.



, When you use a compound adjective to compare two or more things or ideas, you shouldn't use a hyphen. This rule stems from the fact that the meaning of these types of adjectives is clear without the aid of a hyphen. For instance, you would never say that one house is ""better-constructed than the other"", but saying that a house is ""better constructed than the other"" is just fine.


Here are a few examples of comparative and superlative adjectives that don't need hyphens:

After the boxing match, one fighter was clearly more bruised than the other.


Even the best laid plans sometimes go awry.



, Though it's usually somewhat rare that a person with a non-technical background might have to write at length about chemistry-related topics, it's still useful to note that the names of specific chemicals don't contain hyphens. This is true even for chemicals with long names containing multiple prefixes, like monochloroacetic acid.


Here is an example of chemical names where hyphens are not needed:

After adding the cyclopentane to the Erlenmeyer flask, the scientist stirred in 5 milliliters of hydrochloric acid.



, Two symbols called the en dash and the em dash resemble the hyphen but are used for different purposes. En dashes (""–"") are slightly longer than a hyphen, while em dashes (""—"") are even longer. In informal writing, you can usually get away with using hyphens and dashes interchangeably, but in formal contexts, you'll want to keep the uses of each distinct, as it can be considered a grammar error to do so. Following these general rules can help you keep your use of hyphens and dashes distinct. Below are a few of the situations in which you'll need to use dashes:


Ranges of dates, numbers, times, and values (en dashes)
Prefixes for words which don't usually have them (en dashes)
Substituting for blank or missing content (em dashes)
Abrupt sentence interruptions (em dashes)
Punctuating a sentence with extra information (em dashes)

, En dashes are often used to express the idea that two or more words or numbers are connected by a range of values in between. For instance, in the sentence ""We just delivered the Jan–Apr issue,"" the dash implies that the magazine is for January through April, not just January and April. Note that when using en dashes for ranges, you shouldn't put a space on either side of the dash.


Here is an example of an en dash used to express a range:

Would you please schedule me an appointment for 1:00–2:00 PM?



, In general cases, you shouldn't use any sort of punctuation mark for common prefixes like ""pre-"", ""post-"", ""re-"", and so on. However, when connecting this sort of prefix to a word like a proper noun, a complex phrase, or a word that would look awkward or cumbersome without some sort of separating mark, it's acceptable to use an en dash. Obviously, however, en dashes shouldn't be used for words like ""preselect"" or ""postgame"" where the meaning is already clear.


Here are a few examples of en dashes used to attach prefixes:

The professor's degree in the pre–Cold War history of Russia qualified him to teach his course on Czar Nicholas II.


Post–Andy Kaufman, the comedy landscape just didn't seem as vivid.



, Em dashes can be used to abruptly break the flow of a sentence to convey related information, add commentary, and more. Em dashes used in this way can either come before the words inserted into the middle of the sentence or before and after them if the original sentence continues after the interruption. Unlike typical hyphen and dash usage, some grammatical resources allow you to separate em dashes from the rest of the sentence with spaces when used this way.Below are a few examples of em dashes used to interrupt sentences:

Deborah — who was nineteen — still loved the swings at the local park.


There's no need to lock the door — I'm coming out after you.



, Em dashes can also be used at the end of a sentence to show that the flow of words has abruptly ceased before the sentence would normally have ended. In this case, you shouldn't end the sentence with a period, question mark, or exclamation point as you normally would. This is an especially useful tool for written dialog, as it allows you to show when one character interrupts another by speaking over him.


Here's an example of an em dash being used to show someone's speech being interrupted:

Where are we going? The police are right --—"" ""Shh! They'll hear you.""



, In some cases, when information is intentionally left out, it's acceptable to use one or more em dashes to substitute for the missing words or letters. Often, this is used in citations: some style guides call for three em dashes to be used in place of an author's name when it needs to be listed many times in a row.This can also be used to ""censor"" the names of people or places to keep them confidential.


Here is an example of an em dash being used to substitute for missing information:

The paranormal incident took place in the night sky just outside of the rural town of N——.

"The lump-like thing we feel when overcome by emotion has to do with how the nervous system deals with stress. The part of the nervous system that handles stress is called the autonomic nervous system. It controls bodily functions that we do not consciously control, such as digesting food and pumping blood through the heart. However, the autonomic nervous system is also important in dealing with emotional states.

When an animal encounters a stressful situation, its autonomic nervous system kicks in to allow it to either fight or run away. It does this by increasing the flow of blood and oxygen to the necessary muscles. The same applies to humans. Even when we experience emotions such as grief or sorrow, the autonomic nervous system responds as it would to anger or fear by increasing the flow of oxygen through the body.

To increase oxygen intake, the autonomic nervous system makes us breath faster, and expands the glottis, the opening in the throat that allows air to flow from the larynx to the lungs. The expansion of the glottis in and of itself does not create a lumpy feeling, until we try to swallow. Since swallowing involves closing the glottis, this works against the muscles that open the glottis in response to crying. We experience the resulting muscle tension as a lump in the throat."	0
"Because they have to be able to project their voices over long distances and need extra air volume in order to do so effectively, which requires more energy than normal people can produce on an ongoing basis without becoming exhausted or ill from it. This is why many professional athletes who engage in endurance sports tend to become obese as well (e.g., marathon runners). The same goes with voice projection - it's not just about singing loudly but also being able to sustain that level of vocal output throughout your performance while still sounding like you aren't even trying at all! It's called ""passive vocality"" by some experts because you're essentially using less muscle power when projecting your voice this way instead of actively forcing out every note through strained muscles. Because they're constantly working hard physically during performances, they don't get enough time between shows to recover properly either. They often eat too much sugar before going into show mode since that's what gives them instant bursts of energy"	1

Les espaces analytiques rigides ont été introduits par A. Grothendieck dans les années 1960 pour étudier la cohomologie étale des schémas algébriques sur un corps quelconque. Ils constituent une généralisation naturelle des variétés algébriques affines et projectives, mais ils ne possèdent pas toujours de structure géométrique classique (variétés algébriques). Dans cet exposé nous allons présenter quelques résultats récents concernant l'étude de ces espaces en géométrie diophantienne. Nous verrons que certains problèmes classiques peuvent être étudiés grâce à cette nouvelle approche. En particulier, nous montrerons comment on peut utiliser les espaces analytiques rigides pour obtenir des bornes explicites sur le nombre de points rationnels d'une variété algébrique définie sur un corps fini. Ces travaux font suite aux articles suivants :  - J.-B. Bost, M. Chambert-Loir and C. Soulé, ``Explicit bounds for rational points'', Inventiones Mathematicae, vol. 162, no. 1, pp. 1-33, (2005) - J.-B.	1

We report on optical and near-infrared observations made with the Very Large Telescope (VLT) of the gamma-ray burst (GRB) 051028, which was detected by Swift at 07:55 UT on May 28th 2005. The prompt emission lasted for about 20 s in the 15-150 keV energy range. We find that this event is associated to an elliptical galaxy located at z = 1.62 ± 0.01. A bright afterglow was discovered in the R-band image taken one hour after the trigger time. This source faded rapidly during the first few hours following the burst but remained visible up to day 10.5 post-burst. In addition we detect two other sources within the error circle of the X-ray position. One of them has been identified as a star forming region while the second one could be either another supernova or a faint AGN. Finally, we present photometric data obtained between days 3 and 8 showing evidence for spectral evolution across these epochs.	1

It had no value because of its poor quality (it is not clear if this applies only in relation to the purchase price or also to other qualities). It may be stolen goods as well. The state bought them at an extremely low cost from private individuals who were desperate enough that they would sell anything. This could include stolen property. Some people believe that the government stole these items by buying them illegally under duress. Others think that the government did nothing wrong since there are laws against theft which apply equally to both parties involved - buyer and seller.  There is no mention of any law being broken here. No one has accused anyone else of stealing something. They just feel like their culture got robbed somehow. Because of its poor quality.

"Other comments have hit on part of this explanation, but I'll try to tie it all together.

The human species started in Africa.  To protect ourselves from the harsh, direct sunlight, we evolved with higher levels of melanin in our bodies.  This causes darker skin.  Dark hair was also a favourable evolution - less light can pass through dark hair than light, protecting the skin.

Over time as the human race migrated, mutation continued.  In the branch that became ""white"", mutations that produced paler skin and lighter  hair occurred. This was an advantageous mutation because these humans were living in areas with less direct sunlight, so needed to take advantage of the small amounts they were exposed to (we need sunlight to produce vitamin D).  Through natural and self-selection, the genes for paler skin and blonde hair survived.  Other mutations for lighter hair colours (lighter brown, red) remained for similar reasons.

The reason that other races did not evolve blonde hair (in general, great link to the Solomon Islands case in another comment) is that:

1. It did not give then an environmental advantage, so did not increase chances of survival/reproduction
2. The genes for darker hair colours are dominant over genes for lighter hair colour. Without selective pressures (the environment advantage) to encourage this mutation, any spontaneous hair colour mutations would be lost in future generations without other recessive genes to allow it to be expressed.

Look at it this way - a few hot blondes randomly showed up in early northern human populations. They were healthy, dark-haired humans banged them. Had dark-haired babies with a hidden blonde gene. Eventually those dark-haired babies banged each other, hidden blonde genes met up, blonde baby appeared.  Blonde babies were just as healthy as dark-haired babies, so the genes became more common through mating.

Let's say the same few blondes showed up in southern human populations.  They would burn in the sun and not be able to survive in those conditions.  Some dark-haired humans might bang them because, hey, they were just lying there...but they were not ideal mates as they were unhealthy in that environment and could not survive as well.  A few babies may have been born with hidden blonde genes, but if a second generation blonde baby was born, they would also struggle to survive in that environment.  Blonde genes did not abound.

Edit: I don't know why there is so little variatin in Asian populations. Sorry.

Another Edit: The variety of hair colours that exists in northern cultures is due to sexual selection.  Individuals with a random mutation for red hair, for example, could survive and reproduce in northern areas."	0

"Speaking as a barrister, I can say the following. 

In essence, a good lawyer is one who will do the work. They will go the extra mile and put their heart and soul into their cases. They will read all the case law, know all the facts and essentially be able to explain every factor that helps or hinders them.

Truthfully, the facts will win 90% of cases. 'Bad lawyering' or as we call it, poor advocacy will lose 5% of cases. This is due to someone making a critical mistake, failing to appreciate how important a piece of evidence is or generally doing something silly.

Let's take this famous textbook example of one question too far. One question too far is when you have successfully created doubt in the jury (or trier of facts) mind and you ask one extra question which destroys all the credibility you bought. For example, we want to prove that there was no way that the man could have seen the assault

* Where were you standing when you saw the fight?
100 meters away
* Do you wear glasses?
Yes I do
* Were you wearing them that day?
No I wasn't
* How is your eyesight?
It isn't that good
* What time of day was it?
It was night
* So without good eyesight and at night, you made an identification of the accused?
Yes

THAT'S WHERE YOU STOP! You have totally made your point. A bad advocate gets smug and tries to rub it in. This is a cruel lesson we all learn with experience. That extra step can end up here:

* So how could you POSSIBLY confirm that the person you saw all the way over there was the accused?
Because after he assaulted him, he screamed, ""IM RICK JAMES BITCH and came running past me within meters of my face.

This example is of course over the top, but illustrates something a 'bad' lawyer would do.

Good advocacy will win 3% of cases. These are cases where the facts are not in your favor, but a smart advocate can see an avenue that nobody else thinks to look. 

One of my favourite examples is when I had a case where a client stole a stop sign from an intersection. He was caught red handed, made a confession and had the sign in his possession.  All the elements of the larceny had been made out, BUT, at no stage did the prosecution show who owned the stop sign. It's a logical oversight, obviously the council owned the stop sign and an affidavit from a person from the council highlighting that fact would have proved it in short order. They didn't do this.

For an object to be stolen, it has to have an owner. By proving that this object didn't, we asserted that it had been abandoned. I got a judge who agreed with me and we won.

To sum up, I wouldn't say that I am a particularly good lawyer, but if you get a lawyer who is prepared to do the work and acts like your case is the most important one in the world (because to you, it really is) and has the skills to back it up by looking at the problem through different lenses and doing the research necessary to argue the appropriate angle, then you have a 'good' lawyer."	0
Summer is here! The weather's getting warmer by the day - and we're all looking forward to spending more time than ever before outdoors.  But how do we stay stylish while still being comfortable?  Here at How-To, we've got some tips for you:  If you're going somewhere warm where there's no need for layers (like Florida), then opt for something lightweight like linen pants paired with an oversized t-shirt.   Pair jeans with a crop top and sneakers for a relaxed yet chic vibe.    Wear loose fitting clothing over fitted ones; think about layering as well.     Keep accessories simple... Don't forget sunglasses!  Sunglasses aren't only great protection against UV rays, they're also super fashionable.  You could even consider wearing a pair of aviator glasses for extra style points.    Remember to keep your makeup light during the daytime....   Take care of yourself.  Eat healthy foods such as fruits and vegetables, drink lots of water, exercise regularly, sleep plenty etc..    Have fun!	1
"  Electron properties of graphene are described in terms of Dirac fermions.
Here we thoroughly outline the elastic scattering theory for the
two-dimensional massive Dirac fermions in the presence of an axially symmetric
potential. While the massless limit is relevant for pristine graphene, keeping
finite mass allows for generalizations onto situations with broken symmetry
between the two sublattices, and provides a link to the scattering theory of
electrons in a parabolic band. We demonstrate that the Dirac theory requires
short-distance regularization for potentials which are more singular than 1/r.
The formalism is then applied to scattering off a smooth short-ranged
potential. Next we consider the Coulomb potential scattering, where the Dirac
theory is consistent for a point scatterer only for the effective impurity
strength below 1/2. From the scattering phase shifts we obtain the exact
Coulomb transport cross-section in terms of the impurity strength. The results
are relevant for transport in graphene in the presence of impurities that do
not induce scattering between the Dirac points in the Brillouin zone.

"The authors present an interesting idea in this work - applying batch normalisation (BN) not just at the input-to-state but also state-to-state transitions within Long Short Term Memory Networks(LSTMs). The proposed method has been shown effective for several tasks including text generation/question answering/language modelling etc., which are all typical applications using LSTMs. 
In addition, they provide some theoretical analysis about why BN can be applied successfully here based on its effect on gradient flow through different layers. 

However there still remain open questions regarding how exactly their approach performs compared with other methods like Dropout/L2 regularisation when used together? Also more experiments should have been conducted to see if similar improvements could be achieved over vanilla LSTMs trained without any form of regularisation techniques.  

Overall I think it's worth reading because of its novelty!"	1
" You will need a double-sided (coarse and fine grit) synthetic sharpening stone. You will also need a honing steel, which is typically sold in the form of a lightly-grooved, magnetized iron rod. Both of these materials can be found at your local hardware store.


Sharpening stones have two sides with different grits. The grit measures how rough the stone is, and thus how severely it sharpens. Higher numbers stand for finer grits meaning the lowest number is the roughest surface.;
, The stone is porous, and it needs to fill with water so that the blade doesn't catch. This decreased friction and helps prevent scratches and nicks.You'll want to keep getting the stone wet as you work, so keep some water nearby.

, You can use a damp towel or a silicon baking sheet or hot pad. You do not want the stone moving as you sharpen, as this is the number one way to accidentally end up in the ER.

, Splash some water on top before beginning. You always start with the rougher side of the stone, with the lower grit rating. Many stones start at F 400 (European measurement) or J 1000 (Japanese measurement).








Professional chefs may have multiple stones with many different grits to smoothly craft a point. More variety means you can get a better edge by slowly increasing the resistance.
If you have a broken tip on the knife, fix this before sharpening.


, This can be hard to find, but just do it in pieces. Perpendicular to the stone (blade touching the stone, as if you were cutting), is 90-degrees. Now, angle the blade so that it is halfway between perpendicular and laying on the stone. This is 45-degrees. Now angle the stone to be roughly halfway between this angle and the stone -- you've got it!


A steeper angle always leads to a more durable knife, but too steep and you will risk cracking the edge., This hand provides the control and keeps the edge down on the stone as you work., These fingers are your guides, keeping the knife down and moving it smoothly as you work.


These fingers will naturally slide to help the area you're working on since most stones are not big enough to fit the whole knife.

, This motion should be smooth and fluid, almost like you were lightly slicing off an impossibly thin piece of the stone.








, Friction, when not controlled, is not your friend. Keep the stone wet to prevent accidental damage.









It is often a good idea to wipe any grit off the blade each time your wet the stone again

, With your non-dominant hand, move up to the tip of the blade and focus on that. Then slide down and sharpen the meet of the blade before moving down to the hilt. Try to use the same number of movements for each section.









Don't try and push the blade down into the stone. You want it to stay flush to the stone with every pass, but you don't want to be digging it in., You want both sides to be evenly sharpened, otherwise, the knife will be misaligned. The exact same strategy should be used as the first side.









Feel the opposite side of the knife from the one you've been sharpening. If you feel a little burr or catch on the unsharpened side, it means it's time to flip., Make one pass on the right side, flip the knife, and make another on the left. Both the angle and motion are still consistent, as is the need to keep the stone wet. However, since the finer grit is making smaller, finer changes, you want to ensure that you evenly balance them by alternating sides.








You only need very light pressure down on the knife with the fine grit stone.
Keep the stone extra wet, and wipe the grit from the knife frequently with a damp towel.

, Take your sharpened knife and ""slice"" down the edge of a wooden cutting board, as if you were trying to cut into it. You only need to do it one -- but simply dragging the blade across the cutting board to clean off he cutting edge.







, The next step is to use your steel honing rod (sometimes known as a steeling rod), to make sure the blade is properly aligned. Make sure you use a few passes on each side, and keep honing the blade every time you use it.

"The author of this article is trying to describe how exponential machines work in order for readers who are not familiar with them to understand their use.
Strengths: The author's writing style makes it easy to follow along as he describes each step involved.  He also provides examples that help explain his points clearly.   This helps make understanding easier than if there were no examples at all.
Weaknesses: There isn't much information about these types of machines on other websites besides Wikipedia so I don't know where else people can find more detailed explanations beyond those provided here. If you want to learn more you'll have to do some searching yourself. Overall though it's an informative piece that's worth reading even without knowing anything beforehand because it'll give you enough background knowledge to get started using such machines effectively once you've found out more from elsewhere online."	1
"  Traditional parallel schedulers running on cluster supercomputers support
only static scheduling, where the number of processors allocated to an
application remains fixed throughout the execution of the job. This results in
under-utilization of idle system resources thereby decreasing overall system
throughput. In our research, we have developed a prototype framework called
ReSHAPE, which supports dynamic resizing of parallel MPI applications executing
on distributed memory platforms. The resizing library in ReSHAPE includes
support for releasing and acquiring processors and efficiently redistributing
application state to a new set of processors. In this paper, we derive an
algorithm for redistributing two-dimensional block-cyclic arrays from $P$ to
$Q$ processors, organized as 2-D processor grids. The algorithm ensures a
contention-free communication schedule for data redistribution if $P_r \leq
Q_r$ and $P_c \leq Q_c$. In other cases, the algorithm implements circular row
and column shifts on the communication schedule to minimize node contention.

" Some aesthetic changes will clash against each other. Even worse, you can run out of space to fit all of the pieces on your car. Run all of the ideas past a car expert before making any financial commitments to them.;
, If all you're looking for is a better look, you might find a paint job does everything you want it to. Cars can be painted with specialized spray paint in your garage. Due to the value of your vehicle, it's very important to be slow and consistent with your paint.


If you're painting the car from home, don't forget to give your car a primer coat beforehand.Car modification garages can offer more intense paint jobs with graphics like flames. These are very stylized, but make sure your car model is worthy of the flair before you commit to something so flashy. Graphic flames on a Toyota Camry won't get you the sort of attention you're looking for.

, Tinted windows add fast class to a vehicle. The mystery factor and privacy of tinted windows can make even an average car look posh by comparison.


By replacing factory parts, you may void your vehicle's warranty. Check with the manufacturer before proceeding.

, Changing them for a snazzier design is relatively inexpensive by car mod standards. The subtle difference it makes to your vehicle's appearance won't go unnoticed by those who know where to look.


Make sure your taillight modifications are road-friendly. Although you can change your car's look by replacing the lights on it, you still want to make sure they comply with road regulations.

, While a lot of car modification focuses on the outside presentation, you can revamp your experience on the vehicle by changing the seating. Most stock car seating is cloth-upholstered. For a fashionable touch, replacing this with leather seats is very luxurious.


If you go with leather seating, make sure you take care to maintain it as leather demands.

, This is because car modders tend to have preferences for certain models over others, and more popular models will have a greater number of readymade options. Even a broken down beater can be souped up into something special if you have the money for it. If it's your first time pimping out a car however, you can make it easier on yourself by picking a mod-friendly vehicle to start with.


Look online for some examples of your car model being modded. Some car models will come up with lots of results, while others will draw a blank. The number of results will probably give you an idea whether your car is seen as mod-friendly or not.

, This can be done at a car modification garage. Even a slight drop can have a big effect on the look of your vehicle.


On the other hand, you can boost your suspension up for a more rugged look. This option is popular on trucks and SUVs.
There is a safety concern involved in lowering your car's suspension. Although it may look cool, you'll be sacrificing some of your car's handling in the process. Keep this in mind if you are considering lowering suspension. A faster-looking car doesn't necessarily mean a better one.

, Spoilers are meant to give your car the visual impression that it's fast enough to need some aerodynamic support. Of course, for all except the fastest race cars, spoilers are just for show.Even so, many gearheads find the look of a spoiler very appealing on a car. Depending on how common the add-on is to your model, your mechanic specialist may be able to direct you to a spoiler specially suited to the car you want modded.

, A stereo system doesn't change your car's appearance in any significant way, but a new subwoofer will be felt. If you have the money to spend upgrading your car, giving your stereo a facelift will give your vehicle the soundtrack to boot. Best of all, you can be as cheap or expensive as you'd like with reinventing your sound system. A new pair of front speakers might only set you back $50, while a full-blown stereo system can cost you thousands of dollars.


Bass isn't everything to a stereo system. A rich sound will give you more listening enjoyment than a rig with all its power on the bass end of the spectrum.
Don't be inconsiderate by blasting your subwoofer in crowded areas.

, Hydraulics are a theatrical twist on your car. With hydraulics, you can boost your car's suspension and make it ""dance"". Hydraulics are a big part of car modder culture, and are preferred on vehicles with low suspension, called low-riders. If you want a playful trick to your car, take it to a garage and get this specialized suspension control installed.


Hydraulic suspension is pricey, and many outside the car modding community associate it with gang culture.
If you're in with a car modding community, you might try joining a car hydraulics ""dance competition"".

, If you are interested in increasing the functionality of your vehicle, getting a higher-quality brand of tire for your vehicle can change your experience of driving it. This is an important trick whether you're a car modding or a ""casual"" car owner.


Keep your area's weather in mind when you pick out tires. Some tires are specially designed to function in rain or snow.
Generally speaking, the bigger your wheels are, the less responsive they'll be when you're driving.Try to strike a balance between form and function with your tires.

, These computers determine how much fuel is injected into the engine at different RPMs. If you want to get an added boost (and fuel economy) from your car, you can buy an input panel for your ECU and have it installed in your car. Although it's only recommended you change an ECU's default settings if you know what you're doing, you can squeeze some extra power out of your car just by improving the efficiency of parts you already have.


By cutting out fuel at precise times, you can make your car ""backfire"", shooting a burst of flame out the exhaust when you rev it. This is not recommended for street vehicles however, and should only be approached if you know what you're doing.

, Having you exhaust and muffler replaced with something more sleek can help improve the vehicle's efficiency. Some car modders also enjoy playing around with the sound a car makes. Removing a muffler will make your car sound considerably louder. While this might make the car sound faster, it's also inconsiderate to other people using the road.

, However, these erode with time. Replacing them with durable polyurethane may be a largely invisible improvement to your vehicle, but it can do wonders for a vehicle's handling if you've been driving it a while.

, Car modifications can affect your insurance premiums. It's best to look into the ways each modification may affect your insurance before committing to them. Talk to your insurance company if you're unclear., All the same you'll want to keep legality in mind while modding your car to make sure it's not taken away from you once you're on the road.


Legality will depend on the specific country you're living in. As a general rule, if your car looks more like it's designed for a racetrack, there's probably something about it that conflicts with regulation.

, At the end of the day, you should make sure you're keeping your car safe and useable. Even if something may look cool, nothing is worth putting your life and others in danger.

, Most tasteful mods will be received positively, while more bombastic changes might be seen as a joke by other street users. Make a point of avoiding inconsiderate mods. Removing your car's muffler vastly increases the noise pollution your car will create, and anything that creates excess smoke should be rightly avoided.

"The authors present an interesting approach that combines advantages from both synchronous and asynchronous methods while being able to run efficiently on modern hardware architectures such as graphics processing units.
I am not sure if I fully understand how their proposed solution works but they seem to have found ways around some issues with previous approaches by using multiple threads or processes instead of one single thread per agent which is more efficient when running on multi-core processors like most current desktop computers use today.  The results presented are very promising especially since this work was done only recently so there still seems room for improvement.

"In and around your joints is a very special fluid called ""synovial fluid."" This fluid is like oil or lubricant for the joints. This fluid kind of feels like egg yolk and it is great at making sure your joints don't grind together and hurt. This fluid is made by a kind of skin or membrane inside your joints called a ""synovial membrane."" Now this fluid is pretty cool. It not only oils up the joints but it also protects them from damage. The fluid becomes kind of tough when a force is put on it and immediately goes back to normal when the force is gone (**edit** for those of you wondering this is called a *shear thickening* fluid or a *dilatant*). Synovial fluid also contains quite a few gases like the oxygen you breath in and the carbon dioxide, which you breathe out. The fluid also contains nutrients and so the fluid helps put good stuff into the cells it touches (and cartilage) and takes the waste out, like carbon dioxide. 

When you crack your knuckles you are making a small separation between your joints. This separation increases the volume of the space that your synovial fluid likes to sit in (since you are pushing your bones up and down more than they usually go). Now synovial fluid likes to fill up the entire space it sits in, by quickly making the volume or space larger it creates what we call a ""negative pressure"" like a vacuum almost around around the fluid. When this happens there isn't enough fluid to fill the space so it gets filled by the gases in the fluid. Usually the gases stay in the fluid (they stay in solution like when you dissolve salt in water) but the gas only stays in the fluid (at body temperature) under a certain pressure, when you decrease the pressure the gas gets to escape. This forms a bunch of bubbles that quickly pop and make the cracking sound you hear. 

So far as science knows cracking knuckles don't damage your fingers in any lasting way. The fluid does a really good job of protecting and lubricating your joints and as long as those synovial membranes are healthy you will keep  making more."	0

"  A comparison of the 2MASS flux dipole to the CMB dipole can serve as a method
to constrain a combination of the cosmological parameter Omega_m and the
luminosity bias of the 2MASS survey. For this constraint to be as tight as
possible, it is necessary to maximize the correlation between the two dipoles.
This can be achieved by optimizing the survey window through which the flux
dipole is measured. Here we explicitly construct such a window for the 2MASS
survey. The optimization in essence reduces to excluding from the calculation
of the flux dipole galaxies brighter than some limiting magnitude K_min of the
near-infrared K_s band. This exclusion mitigates nonlinear effects and shot
noise from small scales, which decorrelate the 2MASS dipole from the CMB
dipole. Under the assumption of negligible shot noise we find that the optimal
value of K_min is about five. Inclusion of shot noise shifts the optimal K_min
to larger values. We present an analytical formula for shot noise for the 2MASS
flux dipole, to be used in follow-up work with 2MASS data.
  The misalignment angle between the two dipoles is a sensitive measure of
their correlation: the higher the correlation, the smaller the expectation
value of the angle. A minimum of the misalignment is thus a sign of the optimal
gravity window. We model analytically the distribution function for the
misalignment angle and show that the misalignment estimated by Maller et al. is
consistent with the assumed underlying model (though it is greater than the
expectation value). We predict with about 90% confidence that the misalignment
will decrease if 2MASS galaxies brighter than K_min = 5 mag are excluded from
the calculation of the flux dipole. This prediction has been indirectly
confirmed by the results of Erdogdu et al. (ABRIDGED)

"The paper presents an architecture to parallelize the optimization of nested functions based on the method of auxiliary coordinates (MAC) (Carreira-Perpinan and Wang, 2012). This method decomposes the optimization into training individual layers and updating the auxiliary coordinates. The paper focuses on binary autoencoders and proposes to partition the data onto several machines allowing the parameters to move between machines. Relatively good speedup factors are reported especially on larger datasets and a theoretical model of performance is presented that matches with the experiments.

My main concern is that even though the method is presented as a general framework for nested functions, experiments focus on a restricted family of models (i.e. binary autoencoders with linear or kernel encoders and linear decoders) with only two components. While the speedup factors are encouraging, it is hard to get a sense of their importance as the binary autoencoder model considered is not well studied by other researchers and is not widely used. I encourage the authors to apply this framework to more generic architectures and problems.

Questions:
1- Does this framework apply to some form of generic multi-layer neural network? If so, some experimental results are useful.
2- What is the implication of applying this framework to more than two components (an encoder and a decoder) and non-linear components?
3- It is desired to see a plot of performance as a function of time for different setups to demonstrate the speedup after convergence. It seems the paper only focuses on the speedup factors per iteration. For example, increasing the mini-batch size may improve the speed per iteration but may hurt the convergence speed.
4- Did you consider a scenario where the dataset is too big that storing the data and auxiliary variables on multiple machines simultaneously is not possible?

The paper cites an ArXiv manuscript with the same title by the authors multiple times. Please make the paper self-contained and include any supplementary material in the appendix.

I believe without applying this framework to a more generic architecture beyond binary autoencoders, this paper does not appeal to a wide audience at ICLR, hence weak reject.

"Yes! This is a great trivia question. Here's the story:

When the telegraph was first invented, operators needed ways of communicating clearly, correctly, and *efficiently*. They started inventing official codes as well as slang, habits, in-jokes, and all sorts of stuff that was like an early online culture.

[In one set of those early codes, '73' meant something like ""best regards""](_URL_0_) and was a common greeting. Somehow it leaked out into the IRL world and became something of a fad for people to tap out the Morse Code rhythm of 73 in all sorts of situations. [The Morse pattern for 73 is '--... ...--'](_URL_1_).

But when you're tapping, it's kind of ambiguous whether a pause is supposed to be a dash or a between-letter gap. (Telegraph operators sometimes used a double-tap to indicate a dash before systems started including continuous tones (beeps) that were easier to read.) And somewhere along the line people added another tap to round out the rhythm, changing something that sounded like

    * * *** **** *

Into one that sounded like

    * * *** **** **

And we've been repeating this catchy rhythm ever since, what started way back in 1859."	0
"The paper proposes an evolution upon traditional Recurrent Language Models to give the capability to deal with unknown words. It is done by pairing the traditional RNNLM with a module operating on a KB and able to copy from KB facts to generate unseen words. It is shown to be efficient and much better than plain RNNLM on a new dataset.

The writing could be improved. The beginning of Section 3 in particular is hard to parse.

There have been similar efforts recently (like ""Pointer Sentinel Mixture Models"" by Merity et al.) that attempt to overcome limitations of RNNLMs with unknown words; but they usually do it by adding a mechanism to copy from a longer past history. The proposal of the current paper is different and more interesting to me in that it try to bring knowledge from another source (KB) to the language model. This is harder because one needs to leverage the large scale of the KB to do so. Being able to train that conveniently is nice.

The architecture appears sound, but the writing makes it hard to fully understand completely so I can not give a higher rating. 


Other comments:
* How to cope with the dependency on the KB? Freebase is not updated anymore so it is likely that a lot of the new unseen words in the making are not going to be in Freebase.
* What is the performance on standard benchmarks like Penn Tree Bank?
* How long is it to train compare to a standard RNNLM?
* What is the importance of the knowledge context $e$?
* How is initialized the fact embedding $a_{t-1}$ for the first word?
* When a word from a fact description has been chosen as prediction (copied), how is it encoded in the generation history for following predictions if it has no embedding (unknown word)? In other words, what happens if ""Michelle"" in the example of Section 3.1 is not in the embedding dictionary, when one wants to predict the next word?

I have ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) which makes it hard for me to focus when working or studying because my brain is always racing with thoughts of what else could be going on in life besides school/work/socializing etc.. It also causes me to get bored easily so if something doesn't interest me I'll lose concentration pretty quickly as well.  This disorder has been an issue since childhood but was only diagnosed recently after years of struggling through high school without any help from teachers who didn't understand how much effort it takes just to keep up with everyone's pace. My parents are very supportive though they don't know exactly what's wrong yet. They've taken me to see several doctors already trying different medications that haven't worked out quite right either due to side effects or not being strong enough. I've tried many things like taking medication, therapy sessions, getting organized by writing lists everywhere... None really helped until now	1

"The authors propose an interesting idea on how to augment datasets using features instead of raw inputs.  The experiments are well-designed and showcase their proposed method's effectiveness.
I think it would make sense if they also discuss some potential limitations/concerns about their work (e.g., what happens when you have no labeled examples?).  Also I wonder whether there might exist other methods which could achieve similar results without requiring additional unlabeled samples from users?  Finally,  while the focus here seems primarily on image classification problems, I'm curious why the authors chose to use RNNs rather than CNNs - perhaps because it's easier to generate synthetic images via interpolation / extrapolation ?

"  We present IFU observations of six emission-line nebulae that surround the
central galaxy of cool core clusters. Qualitatively similar nebulae are
observed in cool core clusters even when the dynamics and possibly formation
and excitation source are different. Evidence for a nearby secondary galaxy
disturbing a nebula, as well as AGN and starburst driven outflows are presented
as possible formation mechanisms. One nebula has a rotation velocity of the
same amplitude as the underlying molecular reservoir, which implies that the
excitation or formation of a nebula does not require any disturbance of the
molecular reservoir within the central galaxy. Bulk flows and velocity shears
of a few hundred km/s are seen across all nebulae. The majority lack any
ordered rotation, their configurations are not stable so the nebulae must be
constantly reshaping, dispersing and reforming. The dimmer nebulae are
co-spatial with dust features whilst the more luminous are not. Significant
variation in the ionization state of the gas is seen in all nebulae through the
non-uniform [NII]/H_alpha ratio. There is no correlation between the line ratio
and H_alpha surface brightness, but regions with excess blue or UV light have
lower line ratios. This implies that UV from massive, young stars act in
combination with an underlying heating source that produces the observed
low-ionization spectra.

"Sunburn is a type of radiation burn caused by exposure to the sun. To put it simply, the radiation from the sun has bombarded the atoms that make up your DNA, causing irreparable damage. These cells with damaged DNA can no longer self-replicate, meaning they must be shed and replaced.

Like any burn, your body responds with inflammation of the affected area. This is the redness we typically associate with sunburn. What is happening is your body's immune system has recognized that there is a region of localized damage to your skin, and has begun to repair that damage by replacing the skin in that area with new cells. 

To do this, it increases bloodflow to the damaged area in order to supply more oxygen to help with the 'repairs'. Depending on how *deep* the damage is, the more extreme the immune response will be (i.e. first, second, or third-degree burns).

Redness can appear within an hour of exposure, but typically you'll experience the most pain between 6-48 hours. The pain and redness you feel is actually your body's response to the sunburn, and will take several hours to fully peak."	0
"  It has been widely shown that the cosmological parameters and dark energy can
be constrained by using data from type-Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), the cosmic
microwave background (CMB) anisotropy, the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO)
peak from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), the X-ray gas mass fraction in
clusters, and the linear growth rate of perturbations at z=0.15 as obtained
from the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey. Recently, gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have
also been argued to be promising standard candles for cosmography. In this
paper, we present constraints on the cosmological parameters and dark energy by
combining a recent GRB sample including 69 events with the other cosmological
probes. First, we find that for the LambdaCDM cosmology this combination makes
the constraints stringent and the best fit is close to the flat universe.
Second, we fit the flat Cardassian expansion model and find that this model is
consistent with the LambdaCDM cosmology. Third, we present constraints on
several two-parameter dark energy models and find that these models are also
consistent with the LambdaCDM cosmology. Finally, we reconstruct the dark
energy equation-of-state parameter w(z) and the deceleration parameter q(z). We
see that the acceleration could have started at a redshift from
z_T=0.40_{-0.08}^{+0.14} to z_T=0.65_{-0.05}^{+0.10}. This difference in the
transition redshift is due to different dark energy models that we adopt. The
most stringent constraint on w(z) lies in the redshift range z\sim 0.3-0.6.

In addition they introduce a concept called ""domain compression"" where similar substructures across different nodes at one level of abstraction are identified and represented only once thereby reducing both storage requirements and computational complexity significantly.  This results in substantial improvements compared to previous approaches especially when dealing with large scale problems like those arising e.g., in recommendation systems. 

Overall this research makes important contributions not just to machine learning but also to computer science more generally since it provides insights about how we might represent knowledge efficiently in future intelligent agents."	1
"The Squeezenet paper came out in Feb 2016, and I read it with interest. It has a series of completely reasonable engineering suggestions for how to save parameter memory for CNNs for object recognition (imagenet). The suggestions make a lot of sense, and provide an excellent compression of about 50x versus AlexNet. (Looks like ~500x if combined with Han, 2015). So, very nice results, definitely worth publishing.

Since the arxiv paper came out, people have noticed and worked to extend the paper. This is already evidence that this paper will have impact --- and deserves to have a permanent published home.

On the negative side, the architecture was only tested on ImageNet -- unclear whether the ideas transfer to other tasks (e.g., audio or text recognition). And, as with many other architecture-tweaking papers, there is no real mathematical or theoretical support for the ideas: they are just sensible and empirically work.

Oh the whole, I think the paper deserves to appear at ICLR, being in the mainline of work on deep learning architectures."	0

"The authors present an interesting idea on how to learn about relationships between entities using artificial intelligence techniques.  They use a combination of convolutional layers followed by recurrent layers which is not too common but seems promising.
I think it would make sense if they could provide some examples where the proposed method works well or fails badly so I am able to better understand what exactly happens during training/learning phase. It might help them get published faster! 
Overall good research proposal though. Good luck!

"The authors present an interesting approach on how they could speed up the training process using introspective methods.  They showcase some promising preliminary results but there seems to be room for improvement especially when dealing with larger datasets such as Imagenet. 
Strengths: 
1) It uses very little extra storage space compared to standard SGD approaches (less than 1%)
2) Computationally inexpensive 3) Can work well even if you don't know much about your dataset Weaknesses: 1) Doesn't perform better than vanilla SGD 2) Not scalable enough  3) No clear explanation why it's working 4) Needs more testing 5) More analysis needed 6) Could potentially overfit 7) Lack of comparison against current state-of-art 8) Need to test its performance across different architectures"	1

In 1896, Halsey W. Taylor lost his father to an outbreak of typhoid fever caused by a contaminated water supply. This personal tragedy led the young Halsey Taylor to dedicate his life to providing a safe, sanitary drink of water in public places. … The historic Double Bubbler projector [spouter] was designed by Halsey Taylor himself, and still ranks as the most important innovation in the industry’s history. It projects two separate streams of water, which converge to provide an abundant `pyramid’ of water at the apex of the stream. This gives the user a fuller, more satisfying drink.”

The folks at Halsey Taylor are being polite here. What they mean is that the Double Bubbler enables you to take in more water and less air when you drink. As a result, you don’t burp. Think of all the delicate social negotiations you’ve been involved in that have gone awry because of an ill-timed eructation (that’s belch for you dropouts). Had you been drinking from a Double Bubbler, that fat contract (job, babe, whatever) might have been yours.

The Double Bubbler serves other purposes as well. You get less spraying, presumably because the water slows down when the two streams merge. The double streams also act as a sort of pressure regulator. If the water pressure is unusually strong one day, a single-stream fountain might give the unwary sipper a shot in the eye. When the twin streams of the Double Bubbler meet, however, their upward momentums tend to cancel out no matter how high the pressure gets."	0

"Visceral fat is not necessarily dangerous in and of itself but is associated with insulin resistance leading to type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome.

Secondly, visceral fat doesn't exactly pile up in specific spots. If your organs are rocks, visceral fat is kind of like the dirt packed around them. It's all over the place and fills a lot of space. This is compared to subcutaneous fat that can be removed  in liposuction, because it's found just under the skin and is kind of in a different layer from the vital organs.

Another issue is that fat is vascularized, meaning that it bleeds. Surgery is performed with a specific goal in mind and is planned to achieve that goal in the least invasive and most efficient way possible. We've stopped cutting people wide open to remove an appendix and instead do these surgeries laparoscopically (could be it's own ELI5) because the least damage possible is done. Surgery is very much something we do when we can't accomplish something in a different way.

Removing visceral fat would be a very long, very bloody surgery that would basically be like digging up a lot of dirt in a lot of places. Think tearing up your backyard. If you did it, it would be a big operation with lots of bleeding and a horrendously long recovery. It's just not practical. Surgery is very traumatic to the body, and this would be a massive one.

There are far more practical options - namely lifestyle modification. It's free, no medicines, no surgery, and has the best outcomes. Bariatric surgery to promote catabolism would also decrease visceral fat if lifestyle modification failed.

Tl;Dr - Cutting things out is kind of a last resort. Cutting out visceral fat is not practical and would be very dangerous because of where it is in the body (everywhere)."	0
The pressure increases with depth and this prevents freezing from occurring. The higher density also means there are more particles per unit volume which makes it harder to form ice crystals because they need space between them. This effect can be seen on Earth as well where glaciers flow down mountains but don't melt until reaching lower elevations (where atmospheric pressure decreases).

"We present the results of our study on super star clusters (SSCs) in which we have found that SSCs can be divided into two categories, namely, those having a single mode and those having a double-mode solution for their density profiles. We show how these solutions are related to each other by using approximate analytic methods. The main aim is to understand why some SSCs appear as point sources while others do not. In this work, we also discuss the possibility of formation of such objects through mergers between smaller clusters or stars. Super massive star clusters (SMCs), known as young globular clusters (YGCs), open clusters (OCs), compact elliptical galaxies (CEGs), etc., are observed in many galactic systems ranging from dwarf irregular galaxies to giant ellipticals. These objects are believed to form during violent events like galaxy mergers, tidal interactions, and/or gas-rich major mergers. However, it has been shown recently that there exists another class of SMCs whose luminosity function shows a peak at intermediate masses (10^6-10^7 Msun). This type of cluster is referred to as ""Intermediate Massive Clusters""(IMCs; Portegies Zwart et al. (2010)). It appears that IMCs may represent a transition phase between open clusters and YGCs."	1
"  High temperature superconductivity emerges in the cuprate compounds upon
changing the electron density of an insulator in which the electron spins are
antiferromagnetically ordered. A key characteristic of the superconductor is
that electrons can be extracted from them at zero energy only if their momenta
take one of four specific values (the `nodal points'). A central enigma has
been the evolution of the zero energy electrons in the metallic state between
the antiferromagnet and the superconductor, and recent experiments yield
apparently contradictory results. The oscillation of the resistance in this
metal as a function of magnetic field indicate that the zero energy electrons
carry momenta which lie on elliptical `Fermi pockets', while ejection of
electrons by high intensity light indicates that the zero energy electrons have
momenta only along arc-like regions. We present a theory of new states of
matter, which we call `algebraic charge liquids', which arise naturally between
the antiferromagnet and the superconductor, and reconcile these observations.
Our theory also explains a puzzling dependence of the density of
superconducting electrons on the total electron density, and makes a number of
unique predictions for future experiments.

"The authors have done an excellent job in presenting their work clearly with appropriate references.  The experiments are well designed and executed.
I would like to see more discussion about how this approach could be used as part of larger models such as transformer networks which use attention mechanisms between layers rather than just within them (as is assumed here). I think there may still be some benefit from using RNP even if you don't know exactly what layer you're going to attend too but it's worth investigating further.

"The authors present an interesting approach to learning physics from data using deep neural networks (DNNs). The main contribution of this work is that it provides a differentiable physics engine which can be used as part of DNN training.
This allows one to learn both dynamics models directly from sensor measurements without requiring any hand-crafted features. 
In addition, they show how their method works on several simulated robotic tasks such as pushing objects with a robot arm. 

However, there are some issues I have noticed while reading through the manuscript.  

First, although the proposed framework seems promising, its performance still needs improvement compared to state-of-the-art methods.  For example, when applied to push recovery task shown in Figure 1 , the results seem worse than those reported in [1] . 
Second, since the presented model relies heavily on supervised learning techniques, it may not generalize well across environments where no labeled data exists.    In fact, if we consider real-world applications like autonomous driving cars, collecting large amounts of ground truth labels will likely become very challenging due to safety concerns.   Thirdly, the current implementation requires significant amount of computational resources making it difficult to run online during real-time control experiments.     Finally,"	1
"The Road to the Heart is a 1909 American short film, a dramedy directed by D. W. Griffith and produced by the Biograph Company of New York City. Starring David Miles, Anita Hendrie and Herbert Yost, the production was filmed in two days in March 1909 at Biograph's studio in Manhattan. It was released in April that year and distributed to theaters on a ""split-reel"", which was a single film reel that included more than one motion picture. The other picture that accompanied this comedy was the Biograph comedy Trying to Get Arrested.

Plot
Various 1909 film-industry publications provide basic summaries of this photoplay's plot. The trade journal The Moving Picture World is one that describes the storyline in its April 3 issue:

Film reviewer H. A. Downey in The Nickelodeon, another widely read trade journal in 1909, provides in its May edition a far more concise summary of Griffith's screenplay than the one found in The Moving Picture World. Downey describes the film as ""A verification of the theory that the road to the heart is through the stomach, as set forth in the case of Miguel, who, disapproving of his daughter's marriage, drives her from home, but relents for the sake of a hearty meal.""

Another summary of this short's plot is in the extensive 1985 publication Early Motion Pictures: The Paper Print Collection in the Library of Congress. The following was composed by Library of Congress staff after reviewing a paper roll of small photographic prints preserved in the LC's collection. Those prints date from 1909 and were produced directly, frame-by-frame from Biograph's now-lost 35mm master negative of The Road to the Heart:

Cast

David Miles as Miguel, wealthy Mexican ranchero
Anita Hendrie as Vinuella, Miguel's wife
Herbert Yost (also credited Barry O'Moore) as José
Florence Lawrence as Miguel's daughter and José's wife
John R. Cumpson as Chinese man
Clara T. Bracy as Irish cook
Mack Sennett as vaquero (cowboy)
Arthur V. Johnson as vaquero (cowboy)

Production
The screenplay for this short is credited to director Griffith, who shot the picture at Biograph's headquarters and main studio, which in 1909 were located inside a renovated brownstone mansion at 11 East 14th Street in New York City. Filming was completed in just two daysMarch 4 and 5, 1909by Biograph cinematographer Arthur Marvin.

The short's ""anonymous"" actors
Compiling and verifying cast members in early Biograph productions such as The Road to the Heart is made more difficult by the fact that Biograph, as a matter of company policy, did not begin publicly crediting its performers and identifying them in film-industry publications or in newspapers advertisements until four years after the release of this short. In its April 5, 1913 issue, the Chicago-based trade journal Motography in a news item titled ""Biograph Identities Revealed"" announces that ""at last"" Biograph ""is ready to make known its players."" That news item also informs filmgoers that for the price of ten cents they can purchase a poster from Biograph on which the names and respective portraits of 26 of the company’s principal actors were featured. 

The co-stars of this short were among many early Biograph players who performed anonymously and were consistently uncredited in their screen appearances for the studio. Florence Lawrence, in the role of Miguel's daughter in this film, was known in 1909 to theater audiences only as the ""Biograph Girl"", although within a few years after this comedy's release, she would be widely publicized as one of the top actors in the United States' motion-picture industry.

Release and reception
With a film length of 618 feet and an original runtime of between nine and ten minutes, The Road to the Heart was released and distributed by Biograph on a split-reel with the 344-foot comedy Trying to Get Arrested. Few impartial reviews or comments about the film can be found in either 1909 trade publications or in city and small-town newspapers that year. Most newspaper descriptions of the short are contained in theater advertisements that circulated throughput various communities in the weeks and months after the film's release.

A Biograph ""dramedy""
In both 1909 publications and in more current references, the genre or production designation for The Road to the Heart varies. The production is cited as a drama or a ""dramatic"" in period release schedules and in Biograph advertisements for the film in trade journals; yet, in theater bills and promotions for the short in available 1909 newspapers, The Road to the Heart is cited at times as a drama but more often as a comedy. The previously cited 1985 reference Early Motion Pictures: The Paper Print Collection in the Library of Congress as well as the online source the Internet Movie Database also categorize the film as a comedy.

In August 1909 the Grand Theater in Brunswick, Georgia promoted the film in the local newspaper as ""a very clever farce comedy that is sure to please."" The Electric Theatre in Conway, Arkansas, categorizedThe Road to the Heart as ""comic"" in its lineup of motion pictures, along with its split-reel companion comedy Trying to Get Arrested, which the theatre erroneously labeled He Tries to Be Arrested. On the other hand, the Jewel Theatre in Astoria, Oregon, like Biograph's promotions in trade publications, advertised the short as a ""Dramatic"". All of these varying descriptions and others have led to general uncertainties about the film's actual genre or type, so much so that the online reference the ""Progressive Silent Film List"" at Silent Era simply categorizes the short with question marks: ""[?]Drama?"". Given such uncertainties associated with the presence of both dramatic and comic elements in this short's plot, the production is perhaps best classified as a dramedy.

Preservation status
A visual record of The Road to the Heart does exist. The Library of Congress (LC)) holds a 241-foot roll of paper images printed frame-by-frame directly from the comedy's original 35mm master negative. Submitted by Biograph to the United States government shortly before the film's release, the roll is part of the original documentation required by federal authorities for motion-picture companies to obtain copyright protection for their productions.

While the LC's paper print record is not projectable, such paper copies can be transferred onto modern polyester-based safety film stock for screening. In fact, during the 1950s and early 1960s, Kemp R. Niver and other LC staff restored more than 3,000 early paper rolls of film images from the library's collection and transferred many to safety stock. The UCLA Film and Television Archive, for example, has in its collection such a reproduction, but not one of The Road to the Heart. Instead, the archive has a copy of the first film directed by D. W. Griffith, the short Adventures of Dollie. That projectable reproduction was created from a copy of the LC's paper print of that 1908 film.

"You will find that there’s no end to what you can do when it comes to transforming ordinary items around your home.  You don’t even necessarily need to spend lots of money either – sometimes an idea like using plastic bags filled with sand instead of pumpkins works well too! .
To make sure everyone gets their share of spookiness during the party night here are some more suggestions from wikiHow readers who shared their own tips and tricks.

Make a zombie attack window display

This one was created by reader Sarah Hicks (aka The Witching Hour) and her daughter Hannah. 

Sarah says: “We made two sets - one for each side of my front door. We used white poster board, glue gun, scissors, paint pens, googly eyes, fake blood, cotton wool balls, ribbon, wire hangers and cardboard boxes”.  

“My husband painted them while I did the rest..."" 

Transform a dinner table into a haunted scene

"The following steps will help you discover your true vocation.  This list was created from my own personal experience over many years.   It has been tested on myself personally and also used successfully with others who were looking for their life’s work.    The first step towards realizing our dreams is knowing them!  We all know we should follow our heart but sometimes it's hard to figure out exactly... What does your heart desire?   How would you feel about spending every waking moment pursuing an interest?  Wouldn't you love to wake up each morning excitedly anticipating going to work?
What kind of things excite you most when you're young?  Do they still hold any appeal today?  If you've never explored those passions before now - don't worry;  there's plenty of time left in your life to start!
Do you dream of traveling around the globe?  Or perhaps you'd prefer to settle down somewhere warm and sunny?  Maybe you just want to live close enough to family members to visit regularly.  Whatever your ideal lifestyle looks like,..."	1
"The authors propose an algorithm to optimize hyperparameters in machine learning models using bandit-based configuration evaluation (BCE). The BCE approach is based on Thompson sampling which selects configurations with high expected utility.
This work has several interesting aspects that are worth mentioning.  First of all, it presents a novel way to evaluate different model configurations without requiring expensive cross-validation experiments as done traditionally.   Second, this method can be used not only for optimizing parameters but also other types of configurable components such as data preprocessing steps.    Thirdly,  the proposed solution does not require any prior knowledge about how many optimal solutions exist nor their values. 
However there are some issues I would like to point out. 

First, although the authors claim they do not need information regarding number of optima, one should keep in mind that if we have no idea whether our search space contains multiple local optima  or even global ones at all,   the performance may suffer from poor exploration strategies when compared against algorithms designed specifically for multi-optima problems.  
Second, while the authors show results where the final selected configuration performs better than random selection, these improvements seem marginal especially considering the fact that the initial set of candidate configurations was already carefully chosen beforehand.  

Overall, despite its limitations, this research provides useful insights into configuring ML systems"	1
" Do what you can.

, Lord, I expect Your blessing as Your will is done in my life."" This approach holds true in business, at home or in school. Ask the guidance of our Almighty Father. Always ask his permission and blessing in everything you do; don't forget to pray about your dreams in life.

, Then trust God to strengthen you.

, Know your privileges of asking for assistance in the situation and overcome your doubt. God blesses those who believe Him and act on that faith with confidence in Him. The second you need to do is hard work to reach your dreams. Always think positive about your dreams. Always remember this saying ""If others can do it, why can't I?""

, God promises to show you His will in John 16:13, ""However, when He, the Spirit of truth, has come, He will guide you into all truth; for He will not speak on His own authority, but whatever He hears He will speak; and He will tell you things to come."" Jeremiah 33:3, ‘Call to Me, and I will answer you, and show you great and mighty things, which you do not know.’

, Help me to show your Love to others. Pray with thankfulness: ""Continue earnestly in prayer, being vigilant in it with thanksgiving."" Colossians 4:2

, Forgive so that you can be forgiven! Be a peacemaker and peace keeper...

, Words of faith in God are the most powerful things in the Universe. God said, ""Let there be light"" and there was light. It was His will. Yes, it's like the law of gravity will tell you that you can't last very long walking in the air. So you must believe God's promises (His will.) are laws that are as sure as gravity. Believe to receive.

, That is what it is: it's yours. You must continue praising God for the answer whatever it is--even if you do not agree with the timing or the way it comes.

,,, Go forward believing; look up and expect the answers to happen, and leave them to the power of the will of God. If your dreams don't come true don’t get depressed and most of all don't loose hope. Always remember that God may be preparing a better dream for you to fulfill. Remember also that in every failure and success there is always a reason. When God closes one door, He opens another.

, He sees it all.

, It will never work!

Justice is coming and ""you shall receive the desires of your heart,"" so watch the bad attitudes or your ""rewards"" can be opposite of your desires whether in the short or long run.

One is never perfect, but ""God is always just."" He knows how one accepts His good graces, gifts, shares his abilities, and knowledge and how one, then forgives those who seek forgiveness and does not despise the weak or hopeless.

, And, believe that He is already answering your prayer... it's that little thing called ""faith""!""Do not fret... or be envious of those who do wrong... 'Trust' in the LORD, and 'do good'... 'Delight' yourself 'in the LORD' and he will give you the desires of your heart. 'Commit' your way to the LORD..."" Psalms 37:1 - 5 "	0
"  (Abridged) We develop a model for the cosmological role of mergers in the
evolution of starbursts, quasars, and spheroidal galaxies. Combining halo mass
functions (MFs) with empirical halo occupation models, we calculate where major
galaxy-galaxy mergers occur and what kinds of galaxies merge, at all redshifts.
We compare with observed merger MFs, clustering, fractions, and small-scale
environments, and show that this yields robust estimates in good agreement with
observations. Making the simple ansatz that major, gas-rich mergers cause
quasar activity, we demonstrate that this naturally reproduces the observed
rise and fall of the quasar luminosity density from z=0-6, as well as quasar
LFs, fractions, host galaxy colors, and clustering as a function of redshift
and luminosity. The observed excess of quasar clustering on small scales is a
natural prediction of the model, as mergers preferentially occur in regions
with excess small-scale galaxy overdensities. We show that quasar environments
at all observed redshifts correspond closely to the empirically determined
small group scale, where mergers of gas-rich galaxies are most efficient. We
contrast with a secular model in which quasar activity is driven by bars/disk
instabilities, and show that while these modes probably dominate at Seyfert
luminosities, the constraints from clustering (large and small-scale),
pseudobulge populations, disk MFs, luminosity density evolution, and host
galaxy colors argue that they must be a small contributor to the z>1 quasar
luminosity density.

" According to standard MLA formatting rules, a cover page, or separate title page, is not necessary and should not be added to most papers.


With that in mind, sometimes an instructor will ask students to create a cover page for an MLA style paper, especially for long papers. There are guidelines concerning the type of information that should be included in this event.;
, Your title should be centered and typed one-third of the way down from the top of the page.The title of your page should be informative yet creative.
If you include a subtitle, type it on the same line as the title and separate the two with a colon after the title.
The first letter of every major word should be capitalized. Do not capitalize minor words, like “the,” “and,” or “to,” unless they are the first word of the title or subtitle.

, In the middle of the page, still centered, you should type your name proceeded by the word “By.”


Type “By” on one line, hit the “Enter” key on your keyboard, and type or full name on the following line.
Your name should be in FirstName LastName format.

, Two-thirds down from the top of the page, you should include this block of essential information about the assignment itself.


Type the class and section number on one line.
On the line immediately after, write the instructor's name.
On the final line, type the date your paper is due in Month Numerical Day, Numerical Year format.

, The top, bottom, left, and right margins should each be 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide.


For most word processing programs, you can change the margins by heading into the ""Page Layout"" settings, usually located under a ""File"" menu. There should be a ""Margins"" heading in the dialog box. From there, change each margin to the appropriate size.

, From the first page on, your entire paper should be double-spaced. Note that you do not need to include any extra space at the end of a paragraph.


For most word processing programs, you can change the spacing by going into the “Page Layout” settings, typically accessed from a “File” menu.” There should be a “Line Spacing” heading in the dialog box. Under that heading, select “2.0” spacing.

, The preferred font and size for MLA papers is 12-point Times New Roman.


If you opt to use another font instead of Times New Roman, choose a font that is simple, easy to read, and not excessively large.

, A running header will appear on each page in the same spot. It should include your last name and the page number of each page, and should be positioned in the upper right corner of the page.


Access the ""Header and Footer"" tool in your word processor, often found under the ""View"" menu. Type your last name and hit the page number icon in the options box to automatically insert the current page number on its corresponding page.

, The heading essentially includes all the information a cover page would include when used. Type your full name, instructor's name, course name, and due date in the upper left corner.


Type your full name FirstName LastName on the first line.
On the next line, type your instructor's title and name.
On the third line, type the the class course number.
Include the date your assignment is due on the last line. It should be in Numerical Day Month Numerical Year format.

, On the line immediately following the date, you should type your paper's title. This title should be centered.


Do not make the title larger, italicized, underlined, or bold printed.
The title of your page should be informative yet creative.
If you include a subtitle, type it on the same line as the title and separate the two with a colon after the title.
The first letter of every major word should be capitalized. Do not capitalize minor words, like “the,” “and,” or “to,” unless they are the first word of the title or subtitle.

, On the line immediately following the title, left-align your text and begin writing the introduction paragraph of your paper.

, The first line of each paragraph must be indented by 1/2 inch (1.25 cm).


Indent the first line by hitting to “Tab” key on your keyboard.
You do not need to separate paragraphs with extra line spacing. This indentation alone is enough to mark the start of a new paragraph.

, If your paper is long, your instructor may request that you separate certain portions of it into various section headings.


The recommendation for section headings under the MLA style is to number each section with an Arabic number and a period. Follow the period with a space before typing the section name.The first letter of each word in the section name should be capitalized.
Section headings should usually be centered on the page and given their own separate lines.

, When you include a table or figure in your MLA paper, center the figure and provide a figure number, label, and source information.


Use ""Fig. 1,"" ""Fig. 2,"" etc. for illustrations and photographs. Use ""Table 1,"" ""Table 2,"" etc. for tables and charts.
Quickly label the figure with a descriptive term like ""cartoon"" or ""statistical table.""
Provide the creator's name, the source the figure was published in, the date of publication, and the page number.
All of the information should be included on a single line below the picture.

, Whenever you include a direct quote, paraphrase, or summary in your paper, you must cite the source of that material in parentheses after the material is presented.


When the information is available, include the author's last name and the page number from which the material came.
If the materials came from an online source and no page number is available, you only need to include the author's name.
If no author's name is available, include an abbreviated portion of the source material's title.
Note that if you introduce the author's name earlier in the sentence, you do not need to include the name in the parentheses, as well.

, Most quotations will be “in-line,” meaning that no special formatting is required and they can be treated as normal text.


Always include a quote as part of another sentence. Never write a “hanging quote,” a type of quotation in which only the quote is presented without any lead in.
Commas and periods should follow the parenthetical citation, and the parentheses should fall outside of the ending quotation marks.

, Quotes that are longer than three lines should be separated from the rest of the text in the form of a block quote.After you type the last word that comes before your quote, hit the ""Enter"" key to move to a new line.
Each line of a block quote should be indented another 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) in.
You do not need to include quotation marks for a block quote, but you still need to include a parenthetical citation.

, Do not italicize, bold, or underline this heading.If you inserted any notes into your document, the notes themselves should be included as endnotes that are listed on a separate page after the main body of the paper. Do not include them as footnotes, which are listed at the foot of each page as they appear.

, If you inserted your endnotes using an endnote tool on your word processor, the numbering should already be done for you.


Otherwise, make sure that each endnote is proceeded by an Arabic number that corresponds to a number places in the section of the paper's body that relates to the information provided by the endnote.
The first line of each endnote should be indented by 1/2 inch (1.25 cm).

, Endnotes should be used to discuss information that does not coherently fit into the paragraph it relates to.


Your endnotes should not exceed three or four lines in lengths. Avoid long discussions. Endnotes are not the right time to bring up entirely new points.

, Do not italicize, bold, or underline the heading.


If including multiple appendices, label each as “Appendix A,” “Appendix B,” and so on.

, The information in an appendix should relate to the information in your paper, but it should not be crucial or essential to your argument.


An appendix is a way to include related information without distracting from the main argument of your paper.

, Do not italicize, bold, or underline the heading.


Your “Works Cited” page should include all the texts you directly referenced in the body of your paper.
All papers written in MLA format must include a “Works Cited” page.

, All of your citations should be listed in alphabetical order according to the authors' last names.


If a text does not have a known author, arrange that citation in alphabetical order according to the first word of the article or book title.

,


Write the author's name in LastName, Firstname"" format. Follow with a period.

Italicize the book title and capitalize the first letter of each word. Follow with a period.
Write the city of publication followed by a colon, and include the publisher's name after that. Follow this with a comma and the year of publication. End with a period.
Type the medium of publication, ""Print"" or ""eBook,"" at the end. Finish with a period.

, A standard journal article includes the author's name, title of the article, title of the journal, issue information, and medium of publication.

"The authors present some interesting ideas about how to use pointer net as well as LSTMs for question answering problems.
However I think there are still several issues worth discussing further. 

First, it would be good if you could provide more details regarding your experimental settings such as: 

How many epochs did you train each experiment? How long was training time per epoch? 

Second, what does ""boundary"" mean exactly?

Thirdly, 

What happens when the answer length exceeds the maximum allowed length? Does this affect accuracy or just cause longer response times?  What can happen during inference phase ?

In this talk, we will discuss the relationship between the Thurston norm and normal surfaces in 3-manifolds.  We will begin by recalling some basic definitions about the Thurston norm on homology classes of surface bundles over circles (or equivalently, mapping tori).  Then, using techniques developed by Gabai, we will show that any class with positive Thurston norm can be represented by an embedded surface which is incompressible and not boundary-parallel.  Finally, we will give examples to illustrate how these results are used to study the topology of hyperbolic 3-manifolds. The Thurston norm was introduced in 1982 as part of the solution to the Geometrization Conjecture for Haken manifolds.   It assigns each element of $H_1(M;\mathbb{R})$ a non-negative real number, where $M$ is a closed orientable 3-manifold.  This assignment satisfies certain natural properties, including additivity under connected sums and multiplicativity under finite covers.  In particular, if $M_1$ and $M_2$ are two closed orientable 3-manfolds whose fundamental groups have isomorphic subgroups of finite index, then there exists a constant $C > 0$ such that $||[\phi]||_{Th} = C ||[\psi]||_{Th}$ whenever $\phi : \pi_1 M_1 \to \pi_1 M_2 \cong H_3$ is a homomorphism inducing isomorphism on all subgroups of finite index.    If $\mu \in H_1(M;\mathbb{R};\mathbb{Z})$ represents a fibered knot or link in a closed oriented 3-manifold, then its Thurston norm measures the complexity of the associated fibration.  For example, if $L \subseteq M$ is a fibered torus knot or link, then $||\mu||_{Th} = 1$ if and only if $L$ bounds a Seifert surface in $M$.  On the other hand, if $L$ does not bound a Seifert surface in...	1
"The authors present some interesting ideas but I think they need more work before publication.  The first part seems too easy compared to what follows later; it would have helped if this had been explained better or omitted altogether as it's only tangential to their main point anyway.
In addition, the second half needs further explanation - how do you prove something like ""there exists a constant $c > 0$ such that...""? It should also be made clear whether you're talking about one-dimensional or multi-dimensional problems here. Finally, I'd suggest rewriting parts where you've used terms like ""uniformly approximates""; that's confusing at best! 
Overall though, I'm impressed enough by your idea to give you my vote so long as you address all those points above. Good luck!"	1
The Min system is responsible for the correct positioning of the Z ring and division site at mid-cell during bacterial cell division.  The Min system consists of three components, MinC, MinD, and MinE that oscillate back-and-forth across the cytoplasm to create an inhibitory gradient along the length of the cell.  This gradient prevents assembly of new FtsZ rings outside of mid-cell until all existing FtsZ rings have disassembled.   In this study we use computational modeling techniques to investigate how the Min system partitions its components into two daughter cells following cytokinesis.  We find that the Min system can be divided into four distinct phases based on the distribution of Min protein complexes within each cell.  During phase I (0-60 s), MinD-E2-MinC complexes are distributed throughout both mother and daughter cells with higher concentrations near the poles than at mid-cell.  Phase II (60-120 s) begins when MinD-E2-MinCs accumulate at mid-cell forming a band-like structure.  During phase III (120-240 s), MinD-E2-	1
"  We present a detailed study of soliton compression of ultra-short pulses
based on phase-mismatched second-harmonic generation (\textit{i.e.}, the
cascaded quadratic nonlinearity) in bulk quadratic nonlinear media. The
single-cycle propagation equations in the temporal domain including
higher-order nonlinear terms are presented. The balance between the quadratic
(SHG) and the cubic (Kerr) nonlinearity plays a crucial role: we define an
effective soliton number -- related to the difference between the SHG and the
Kerr soliton numbers -- and show that it has to be larger than unity for
successful pulse compression to take place. This requires that the phase
mismatch be below a critical level, which is high in a material where the
quadratic nonlinearity dominates over the cubic Kerr nonlinearity. Through
extensive numerical simulations we find dimensionless scaling laws, expressed
through the effective soliton number, which control the behaviour of the
compressed pulses. These laws hold in the stationary regime, in which
group-velocity mismatch effects are small, and they are similar to the ones
observed for fiber soliton compressors. The numerical simulations indicate that
clean compressed pulses below two optical cycles can be achieved in a
$\beta$-barium borate crystal at appropriate wavelengths, even for picosecond
input pulses.

"Game Genie's worked a little different depending on each system because each system treated cartridges a little different.

In general a Game Genie was designed to sit between the console and the cartridge and when the console asked the cartridge for data the game genie could secretly change it before passing it back to the console.

So for example you have a game where you start with 3 lives. That number 3 exists somewhere in the data or code on the cartridge. Let's assume the number 3 is stored at the 5000th byte of the cartridge's data bank. On the Game Genie you'd enter a code like ""50 00 99"". This would tell the genie that every time the console tried to load the number from address 5000 to send back a value of 99 instead of what was really there. Now when a new game starts you have 99 lives because that's the number the console recieved.

While that code is obvious in its meaning the genie usually used scrambled codes in a known way, so for example you might actually enter the code ""90 05 09"" and it would get unscrambled into the more meanful code.

Different consoles had different ways of working. On the NES the cartridge was linked directly into the CPU bus in such a way that it could control *all* memory, not just the cartridges (this allowed NES cartridges to enhance the original hardware, not just provide game data) by routing any memory access through the cartridge pins first. This means that the cartridge could even override the data in the consoles built in ram. 

So Game Genie codes for the NES might do things like ""hold"" a byte. What this means is that it essentially kept a value in RAM locked - attempts to change it wouldn't work. So you have a place in ram where health was stored and when health reached 0 you are supposed to die. The game genie could just hold that value at 99 and now you are invincible."	0
Apple uses its own proprietary connector, Lightning Connector (LCC), which is incompatible with Micro-USB connectors and other devices using them such as Android smartphones or tablets. The LCC was introduced alongside iPhone 5 on September 12, 2012.  This allows Apple to sell their products without violating European Union law because they are not compatible with any of the existing standards used by competitors' products. They also have an adapter available so you can plug it into your computer's charging port if needed. Because this isn't widely adopted yet, most people don't know about it. It has been criticized heavily since it's release due to lackluster performance compared to competing technologies like micro-usb and lightning cables. Apple uses its own proprietary cable instead of standard ones. Most people do not realize there is no way to charge these phones from another device besides apple computers unless you buy one of those adapters. Apple uses its own cable	1
This method is great if you'd like to try something different than regular box dyes.  It will give you bright colors without damaging your hair! This process takes about 24 hours but it's worth every minute!  You can also add food coloring instead of Kool-Aid powder.   The following steps should be followed when using this method:  1. Prepare yourself by putting on rubber gloves so you don't stain your hands while mixing everything together.    2. Place all three boxes of Kool-Aid inside one large bowl.     3. Pour enough warm/hot tap water over each packet of Kool-Aid to dissolve the contents completely.    4. Once you've dissolved the Kool-Aid mix thoroughly with a spoon/fork/mixing stick.    5. Apply the mixture onto damp/dry hair depending upon how dark/tight/saturated you would like your final result to look.    6. Cover your hair tightly with cling film/baggy/shower cap overnight.    7.

, Add the wine and the tomato paste and then the meat.

,, It should boil somewhat throughout the entire cooking process of 1 1/2 to 2 hours. The meat should be very tender after 1 1/2 but, it can be cooked for up to 2 hours if you want to be absolutely sure it's done (larger cuts). Once it's done remove it from the liquid. Keep the meat warm and covered with aluminum foil in your oven-at a warming, not backing heat temperature. Strain the liquid into a metal bowl and use a spoon to press the vegetables squeezing as much of the liquid out of them as possible.

,, They should be the very last thing that's ready and when you strain them the rest of the meal should already be on the table, waiting to be served.

, Stir in the strained liquids, the heat should be set high because the sauce must cook vigorously till it thickens, you will have to stir (also vigorously) while it cooks to keep it from burning at the bottom.

"It's counter intuitive, because you'd think everything would be easier that way, but the current way is actually easier on instrumentalists.

Take the trumpet for example.  The most common trumpet is pitched in Bb.  It has a nice, open, brassy sound.  But the C trumpet is a bit brighter, and is often used in orchestral music.  So a well-rounded trumpet player would have to learn to play the instrument twice.

We avoid that by writing the music differently.  So a trumpet player sees the note F, on the bottom space of the staff.  If he's playing a C trumpet (concert pitch), he holds down the first valve and plays an F.  If he's playing a Bb trumpet, he holds down the first valve and plays a concert Eb, which he calls an F.  Either way, he uses the same fingering and similar embouchre.  Same with middle C - one line below the staff.  On both trumpets, you'd see the note and play an open fingering - on a C, it's a C, on a Bb, it's a Bb.

So because of that, the trumpet player only has to learn the instrument once.  Even if he's never seen a C trumpet before, he can pick one up, read the music (which is in C - concert pitch), and play it perfectly... it'll just sound a whole step higher than if he'd played his Bb trumpet."	0

"We present the results of an optical spectroscopic survey aimed at finding tidal dwarf galaxies (TDGs) candidates among a sample of ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRG). We have obtained spectra with FORS2@VLT and GMOS-N@Gemini telescopes, covering the wavelength range between 3600 Å and 9200 Å , for a total of 16 ULIRGs selected on the basis of their high far-infrared luminosity (L FIR > 10 12 L ⊙ ) and low redshift (z < 0.1).
The main goal is to find TDGs that are expected to be found around interacting systems such as ULIRGs. The presence of young stars in these objects would make them detectable through strong emission lines like Hα or [OII] . However, we do not detect any significant excess of emission line flux over what can be explained by star formation occurring within the host galaxy itself. This result suggests either that there are no TDGs associated with our sample of ULIRGs or that they are too faint and/or too red to be detected using current facilities."	1

"This work presents a novel approach in modeling the performance of deep networks using machine-learning techniques. The authors propose a new method which they call ""Paleo"" (Performance Analysis of Eager Optimized Learning) by analyzing the computation requirement of each layer during both forward propagation and backward propagation phases.  They also provide some experimental validation showing good accuracy compared against other state-of-the-art methods like TensorFlow or Caffe.
The idea behind this research seems very promising but I think there are still several open questions related to this topic. 

First question is: How does one extract information about layers? This requires knowing what kind of data structure has been used to represent those layers. For example if you use LSTM cells then your representation will be different than when you use fully connected neurons. 
Second question: What happens at runtime ? Does the algorithm need any input parameters before running?  No"	1

"The Women's London Championship (WLC) is an English women's cricket competition. It was created in 2020 following the introduction of the regional Rachael Heyhoe Flint Trophy as the highest domestic competition in women's One Day cricket. The competition features the women's county cricket teams from the Home Counties.

History 
Originally the Women's County Championship was the highest 50 over competition in English women's cricket. However, the tournament ended in 2019 to make way for a regionalised 50-over tournament and The Hundred. This decision was not popular with some of the county teams who felt that the new competition had removed their representation in the top flight of women's cricket. The Women's London Championship was created as a county replacement. The first season in 2020 featured the Home Counties of Kent, Middlesex, Surrey and Essex. Though it was endorsed by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), it was viewed as a breakaway tournament due to a negative perception of the ECB's way of administering women's cricket by reducing the number of teams from counties to regions. The counties also engaged in a running competition as a warmup. The matches would be played at county outgrounds such as Kent playing at the Nevill Ground, Royal Tunbridge Wells and Middlesex playing at Mill Hill School, London. The inaugural competition was won by Surrey.

For the 2021 season, it was announced that Sussex would be joining the competition. The South East Stars and Sunrisers regional teams agreed to release their contracted players to represent their counties in the Women's London Championship. Kent won the 2021 tournament, winning three of their four matches, with defending champions Surrey in second place.

"The following steps show how to find out exactly when Easter falls in your calendar using only basic math skills.  This method works because all years have an even number of days except leap years.   To determine if it's a leap year just check whether Februray has 29 days instead of 28.    If you're looking forward many years into the future you'll want to make sure... 
This wikiHow teaches you how to figure out the date of Easter by hand without relying on computer software like Excel or Google Sheets. You may also wish to read How to Find Easter Using Microsoft Excel.     Step 1: Write down the dates of Easter from 1900 through 2050. These are available online at: http://www.usacatholicschoolbooks.com/easter/calendar-of-easter-dates-1900-2050.html     Step 2: Determine the last digit of the year code. Add up the digits of the year until they equal four. Then multiply them times ten. Subtract these figures from the total number of days since Jan 1st, 1900. The remaining number should be divisible by 7. (For example, 2020 would give you:  2020 - 19 x 10 - 9 = 21 - 190 - 90 = 11 - 210 = -1)  Note that there were no leap years between 1901 and 1930; therefore, their codes remain unchanged compared to those used before 1950.        Step 3: Figure out the day code based upon the month and year. Multiply the month's code by its corresponding factor below. Then add the result to the year code:   Months    Factor        Date Codes         1       1           31              2       2           30               3       3           31                4       4           28                 5       5           31                6       6           30               7       7           31            ..."	1

"The authors propose to use word vectors as features in language modeling tasks.
They show that this approach outperforms previous work on several datasets (e.g., Penn Treebank).
However, they do not provide any explanation of why their method works better than other methods such as n-grams.  The main contribution is an algorithm which learns how to combine different types of information from multiple sources into one model using loss functions. 
This idea seems very promising but it would be interesting if there were some discussion about whether these ideas are applicable beyond text classification problems. 

Strengths: 
1) This article proposes new ways to incorporate external knowledge with neural networks through losses rather than direct connections between layers.
2) It shows improved performance over existing approaches based solely on word embeddings and/or classifiers.

* Summary: This paper proposes a neural machine translation model that translates the source and the target texts in an end to end manner from characters to characters. The model can learn morphology in the encoder and in the decoder the authors use a hierarchical decoder. Authors provide very compelling results on various bilingual corpora for different language pairs. The paper is well-written, the results are competitive compared to other baselines in the literature.


* Review:
     - I think the paper is very well written, I like the analysis presented in this paper. It is clean and precise. 
     - The idea of using hierarchical decoders have been explored before, e.g. [1]. Can you cite those papers?
     - This paper is mainly an application paper and it is mainly the application of several existing components on the character-level NMT tasks. In this sense, it is good that authors made their codes available online. However, the contributions from the general ML point of view is still limited.
                   
* Some Requests:
 -Can you add the size of the models to the Table 1? 
- Can you add some of the failure cases of your model, where the model failed to translate correctly?

* An Overview of the Review:

Pros:
    - The paper is well written
    - Extensive analysis of the model on various language pairs
    - Convincing experimental results.    
    
Cons:
    - The model is complicated.
    - Mainly an architecture engineering/application paper(bringing together various well-known techniques), not much novelty.
    - The proposed model is potentially slower than the regular models since it needs to operate over the characters instead of the words and uses several RNNs.

" A simple way to start is to plan in at least 30 minutes of aerobic exercise at least three days per week. Do exercises that elevate your heart rate, such as jogging, brisk walking, swimming, or cycling.


Exercise has multiple benefits for your health, not the least of which is having a positive impact on your blood pressure so that you minimize your chances of having any blood pressure problems during pregnancy.
Note that, if you are not already active, you should lightly ease into an exercise routine under the supervision of your doctor. Do not begin a new exercise routine suddenly without first consulting your doctor.;
, Your doctor can inform you of a body weight that is healthy and normal for someone of your height and build, should you have any questions about it.


Your doctor can provide you with guidelines as to the weight changes you should aim for as your pregnancy progresses, which will depend on how much you weighed prior to becoming pregnant.
If you are not yet pregnant, use diet and exercise to get as close to your ideal weight as possible before getting pregnant.
Losing weight during pregnancy is not recommended. Even overweight pregnant women are expected to gain weight during pregnancy.

, Quitting smoking will also have a noticeable impact on your baby's health and wellbeing. Therefore, not only is it in the best interest of you, but of your future baby as well.


Your family doctor can help you with strategies to quit smoking, if you are interested.
Your doctor may offer you nicotine replacement as needed, and/or medications to help diminish cigarette cravings (such as Wellbutrin or Bupropion).

, It can certainly help to keep your blood pressure in a safe and normal range during pregnancy.


Avoid consuming too much salt or processed foods (which are high in salt); this will help to prevent blood pressure problems during pregnancy.
Also, opt for healthier foods overall, such as more fruits, vegetables, and whole grain carbohydrates.
This is better for your blood pressure than unhealthier alternatives such as refined carbohydrates, snack foods and junk food.

,


Consider seeing a counsellor or psychologist if you have elevated stress levels. They may be able to help you with coping strategies to reduce your stress.
You may also want to consider activities such as yoga, meditation, or relaxing walks in nature to help calm your state of mind.
It may also help to share your emotions with close friends and family as you progress through your pregnancy. It can be a challenging nine months and it can help to know that you are not alone.

, A normal blood pressure is below 140/90 (where the top number represents the systolic reading and the bottom number represents the diastolic reading). If your blood pressure is elevated above that point, your doctor will likely advise that you be treated with blood pressure medications to reduce it.


You can check your blood pressure on your own at a local pharmacy or big box store should you have any reason to feel concerned.
If not, your doctor will perform regular blood pressure checks at each of your prenatal visits, to ensure that there are no problems.

, Some blood pressure medications are safe during pregnancy, while other are not ideal for pregnant women.


Blood pressure medications to avoid during pregnancy include any ACE inhibitors (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, such as Ramipril and Captopril), any ARBs (angiotensin receptor blockers such as Candesartan), and any renin inhibitors (such as aliskiren). These drugs may cause birth defects or disease in the fetus.
Blood pressure medications that are recommended in pregnancy include Methyldopa and Labetalol. Calcium channel blockers such as nifedipine are also used frequently.

, The risk of high blood pressure during pregnancy often goes hand in hand with other symptoms, such as protein in your urine; therefore, if you demonstrate high blood pressure, your doctor will do a full evaluation of your health at this time.

, It may require treatment with a blood pressure medication, as well as continued monitoring to ensure that no further problems develop (such as preeclampsia).

, Preeclampsia is dangerous for you and your baby, and needs immediate medical treatment. If left untreated, it can lead to eclampsia, which is the onset of seizures. Potential signs of preeclampsia include:


Fatigue
Vision problems
Severe headaches
Rapid weight gain due to swelling
Nausea and vomiting
Reduced urine
Abdominal pain
See your doctor or go to the Emergency Room (if you cannot get a same-day appointment with your family doctor) if you notice the above signs or symptoms.

, Possible complications that may result from high blood pressure during pregnancy that is left untreated include:


A diminished nutrient supply to the placenta. With high blood pressure, less blood flow gets to the placenta which decreases the nutrient supply for your baby. This can lead to poor growth of the baby.
Placental abruption. Placental abruption is when the placenta detaches from the uterus wall as a result of the stress from untreated high blood pressure. This is an obstetrical emergency requiring immediate delivery of the baby.
Premature delivery. Your baby may need to be delivered prematurely if their wellbeing (or your own personal health) is compromised as a result of blood pressure concerns.

The book Nurturing Breakthroughs by James Watson and Peter Winkler is about how to create breakthroughs in science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM). The authors argue that the best way for scientists to make new discoveries is not through individual genius but rather by working together as teams on problems they are passionate about.  They also claim that it helps if you have an idea of what your problem looks like before you start solving it because this will help guide your research efforts. This article describes some of their ideas and provides examples of how these concepts can be applied to physics research. In his book Nurturing Breakdowns, James Watson argues that the most successful people who solve complex problems do so by working with others instead of trying to work alone. He says that when we work individually our brains tend to focus only on one aspect of the problem at hand which may lead us down dead ends while working collaboratively allows us to see all aspects of the problem simultaneously.	1

"To add a little to this, you may be conflating mathematics and arithmetic.  Unsolved math problems are not ""find the solution to this equation"" types of problems.  Here's an example of an unsolved math problem:

Consider a math game where you start with a number.  If it's even, divide it by two.  If it's odd, multiply it by three and add one.  Either way, take the resulting number and apply the same rule to it.  Etc.

So, for instance:

* 1 - >  4 - >  2 - >  1
* 2 - >  1
* 3 - >  10 - >  5 - >  16 - >  8 - >  4 - >  2 - >  1
* 4 - >  2 - >  1  
* 5 - >  16 - >  8 - >  4 - >  2 - >  1

Notice that those examples all eventually reach 1?  Well let me ask you this.  Does *every* number *always* end at 1?  Can you prove it?

This is known as the [Collatz conjecture](_URL_0_), and while many mathematicians suspect that every number ends up at 1 (and every one computed so far has) no one has been able to **prove** that is the case for all possible numbers.

emission from the $z=4.4$ QSO BRI 1335--0417. The observations were carried out
at 1.4 GHz using the High Sensitivity Array (HSA). Our sensitive VLBI image at
$189 \times 113$ mas ($1.25 \times 0.75$ kpc) resolution shows continuum
emission in BRI 1335--0417 with a total flux density of $208 \pm 46 \mu$Jy,
consistent with the flux density measured with the VLA. The size of the source
at FWHM is $255 \times 138$ mas ($1.7 \times 0.9$ kpc) and the derived
intrinsic brightness temperature is $\sim 3.5\times 10^4$ K. No continuum
emission is detected at the full VLBI resolution ($32 \times 7$ mas, $211
\times 46$ pc), with a 4$\sigma$ point source upper limit of 34 $\mu$Jy
beam$^{-1}$, or an upper limit to the intrinsic brightness temperature of
$5.6\times 10^5$ K. The highest angular resolution with at least a 4.5$\sigma$
detection of the radio continuum emission is $53 \times 27$ mas ($0.35 \times
0.18$ kpc). At this resolution, the image shows a continuum feature in BRI
1335--0417 with a size of $64 \times 35$ mas ($0.42 \times 0.23$ kpc) at FWHM,
and intrinsic brightness temperature of $\sim 2\times 10^5$ K. The extent of
the observed continuum sources at 1.4 GHz and the derived brightness
temperatures show that the radio emission (and thus presumably the far-infrared
emission) in BRI 1335--0417 is powered by a major starburst, with a massive
star formation rate of order a few thousand M_{\odot} {\rm yr}^{-1}$. Moreover,
the absence of any compact high-brightness temperature source suggests that
there is no radio-loud AGN in this $z=4.4$ QSO.

"Say Bob has a bunch of stock in a business called Company, Inc.  Bob's friend Henry thinks Company, Inc.'s stock is about to drop significantly.  Henry makes a deal with Bob:  Bob will lend Henry 100 shares of Company, Inc. stock, but Henry has to give it all back exactly one year from now.  So Henry gets 100 shares and sells them at their current price of $10 each.  Henry now has $1000, but he'll have to buy back 100 shares before the end of the year in order to hold up his end of the bargain.

A year later, Company, Inc. stock isn't doing so well, selling for only $1 a share.  Henry buys up 100 shares and gives them back to Bob.  By shorting the Company, Inc. stock, Henry made a profit of $900.

In an alternate universe, Company, Inc. is doing pretty good at the end of the year.  Their stock is selling for $20 a share.  In order to get the 100 shares he needs to give back to Bob, Henry has to use the $1000 he got from selling the stock originally AND $1000 from his own pocket.  In this universe, Henry's attempt to short the Company, Inc. stock has cost him $1000."	0
"  We obtain the phase diagram and thermodynamic behavior of the Kondo necklace
model for arbitrary dimensions $d$ using a representation for the localized and
conduction electrons in terms of local Kondo singlet and triplet operators. A
decoupling scheme on the double time Green's functions yields the dispersion
relation for the excitations of the system. We show that in $d\geq 3$ there is
an antiferromagnetically ordered state at finite temperatures terminating at a
quantum critical point (QCP). In 2-d, long range magnetic order occurs only at
T=0. The line of Neel transitions for $d>2$ varies with the distance to the
quantum critical point QCP $|g|$ as, $T_N \propto |g|^{\psi}$ where the shift
exponent $\psi=1/(d-1)$. In the paramagnetic side of the phase diagram, the
spin gap behaves as $\Delta\approx \sqrt{|g|}$ for $d \ge 3$ consistent with
the value $z=1$ found for the dynamical critical exponent. We also find in this
region a power law temperature dependence in the specific heat for
$k_BT\gg\Delta$ and along the non-Fermi liquid trajectory. For $k_BT
\ll\Delta$, in the so-called Kondo spin liquid phase, the thermodynamic
behavior is dominated by an exponential temperature dependence.

"Well the lowercase letters developped out of the capital letters, also called Majuscules. In ancient times, all letters were written in capital letters. People began to write quickly and if you do that, you tend to make rounder shapes with the pen/writing utensil. The lower case letters developped out of ""sloppy"" handwriting and people just accepted that. So for a long time it simply didnt matter if you wrote with a lower case or upper case letters. Keep in mind that not everyone could read or write and most writing of books happened in monasteries where monks had to copy books page for page, letter for letter. The really rich people would buy a book as a prestigious investment. it'd be comparable to you buying a $15.000 art piece nowadays. 
anyway: in some languages people decided to put focus on certain words, like names and nouns, since those seemed to be more important than the rest. ever since old middle-english that's only true for names, but in Anglo-Saxon(the language out of which old middle-english developed) they pretty much made the same distinction that Germans do nowadays. Nouns and names are capitalized.

fun fact: the english ""I"" is still a relic of the past. There's no real ""need"" to capitalize it. My old English teacher always told us: ""the British people are so self-entitled that they have to write the I in big letters!"" 




Edit for more info:
our modern alphabet developed from the greek letters. But one may wonder how those guys came up with writing an A to represent the sound /a/ . The best example here are the hieroglyphs. They're supposed to be read as any little glyph representing a single sound(consonant or vowel doesn't really matter).I'm taking an english example with egyptian writing style to explain better: Let's say they wanted to write the word ""Bridge"". They'd take the initial sound of a conventionalized wordlist. For instance they would draw a little bread bun to represent the sound /br/, since /br/ is also the initial sound of bridge. The convention is now set. whenever you want to express the sound /br/ all you have to do is draw a little bread bun and anyone would know that the first sound would be /br/. You do that with all the sounds that follow until you spelled out the entire word in little pictures. so instead of  < Bridge > , it would say  < bread, igloo, dog, jeans > . (i know it's not a great example, but i hope you understand)

greeks did something similar, but abstracted much more from the original. the old greek word for cattle began with an /a/ sound. the letter A turned upside down can be seen as something similar to the head of a cow or goat or whatever. you get the point. They did that for every sound that they'd have to represent and came up with the alphabet. over time it got more and more abstract and we ended up with the writing we have nowadays."	0
"Inspired by the analysis on the effect of the co-label similarity (Hinton et al., 2015), this paper proposes a soft-target regularization that iteratively trains the network using weighted average of the exponential moving average of past labels and hard labels as target argument of loss. They claim that this prevents the disappearing of co-label similarity after early training and  yields a competitive regularization to dropout without sacrificing network capacity.

In order to make a fair comparison to dropout,  the dropout should be tuned carefully. Showing that it performs better than dropout regularization for some particular values of dropout (Table 2) does not demonstrate a convincing advantage. It is possible that dropout performs better after a reasonable tuning with cross-validation.

The baseline architectures used in the experiments do not belong the recent state of art methods thus yielding significantly lower accuracy. It seems also that experiment setup does not involve any data augmentation, the results can also change with augmentation. It is not clear why number of epochs are set to a small number like 100 without putting some convergence tests.. Therefore the significance of the method is not convincingly demonstrated in empirical study.

Co-label similarities could be calculated using softmax results at final layer rather than using predicted labels.  The advantage over dropout is not clear in Figure 4, the dropout is set to 0.2 without any cross-validation.  


Regularizing by enforcing the training steps to keep co-label similarities is interesting idea but not very novel and the results are not significant.

Pros : 
- provides an investigation of regularization on co-label similarity during training

Cons:
-The empirical results do not support the intuitive claims regarding proposed procedure
Iterative version can be unstable in practice

Rufus Riddlesberger (born September 16, 1943) is the former mayor of Santa Clara, California and current member of the Santa Clara City Council representing District 1 since 2005.  He was elected to his first term in 2004 after serving as interim Mayor from 2003 until he won election that year.   In 2008, he ran unopposed for re-election but lost by one vote to Sam Liccardo who became the city's new mayor.    Prior to becoming city councilman,  Mr. Riddlesberger served on the Santa Clara Planning Commission where he worked closely with then-Mayor Ron Galperin during the early 1990s when the Silicon Valley boom began.   During this time period,   Mr. Riddlesbergers's work helped secure funding  for several major projects including the construction of the Santa Clara Convention Center which opened its doors in 1993.   After leaving office at the end of 2002, he returned home to San Jose where he continued working in real estate development before returning to Santa Clara in January 2006 to run again for the position of Mayor.   On May 31st 2009, Rufus announced he would not seek another term as Mayor due to health reasons	1
"The Dayton Family is an American hip hop group from Flint, Michigan, composed of Ira ""Bootleg"" Dorsey, Raheen ""Shoestring"" Peterson and Matt ""Backstabba"" Hinkle. Its name derives from Dayton Street, one of Flint's most crime-ridden streets.

Musical career

Early history (1993–2005)
In 1993, Ira Dorsey and Raheen Peterson met through their younger brothers. The two began writing together, under the names Bootleg and Shoestring, and created their first song, ""Dope Dayton Ave"". Rapper Matt Hinkle soon joined the duo under the name Backstabba. The group began working with local producer Steve Pitts and formed The Dayton Family, named after Dayton Avenue, one of the most crime-ridden streets in their hometown of Flint, Michigan. In between studio sessions, they performed at local clubs and quickly gain notoriety within Flint.

The Dayton Family recorded a 12-inch single and soon signed with Atlanta independent record label Po' Broke in 1995. That year, the group released their debut album What's on My Mind? and were featured on No Limits Down South Hustlers: Bouncin' and Swingin' compilation album, which got the trio recognition throughout Southern United States. After the album's release, Hinkle was imprisoned and replaced by Bootleg's younger brother Erick, who performed under the name Ghetto-E. Following a year of touring, the group left Po' Broke due to legal problems with the label's producer and signed with Russ Entertainment .

In 1996, they released their second album F.B.I., standing for Fuck Being Indicted, under Russ Entertainment/Relativity Records. The Dayton Family was plagued with various legal problems, including Ira being incarcerated soon after release of F.B.I., which hindered the amount of work the group released. In 1999, both Ira and Peterson released solo albums. Two years later, the group signed with Detroit rapper Esham's Gothom label and released solo albums. The next year, they released Welcome to the Dopehouse under Koch Records.

Stabilization (2005-2010)
After a three-year hiatus, the group was trimmed down to Ira and Peterson and they released Family Feud through Fast Life Records. The following year, The Dayton Family signed with U Be U Records and released Back on Dayton Ave. The duo added new member Jake the Flake later that same year and released Return to Dayton Ave. in October. Following Hinkle's release from prison, the group returned to their original lineup of Ira, Peterson, and Hinkle. In 2009, they released The Return: The Right to Remain Silent under DDA Records.

Hatchet House (2010-2011)
On July 14, 2010, The Dayton Family signed with Insane Clown Posse's subsidiary label Hatchet House. The group released the EP Psycho on February 1, 2011, and a music video was released for the song ""Cocaine"" on 28 March. Their seventh album, Charges of Indictment, was released on June 28. They most recently featured in the ""Psychopathic Psypher"" Part 1 & 2 (Bootleg in Part 1 and Shoestring in Part 2). The video for ""The Psypher (Part 1 & 2)"" was released on June 5, 2011.

Style and influences
The Dayton Family is known for their gritty lyrics concerning ghetto survival, struggle and poverty. AllMusic reviewer Jason Birchmeier describes The Dayton Family's musical style as ""potent hardcore rap"". He says that the group has ""an idiosyncratic identity"" and ""a dark, grim mentality focused on modest survival rather than riches or fame"". The group lists Run-DMC, Michael Jackson, LL Cool J, N.W.A, Geto Boys, Tupac Shakur, Notorious B.I.G., X-Clan, Spice 1, Esham, Natas and Public Enemy as influences.

"  We study the evolution of the Aromatic Infrared Bands (AIBs) emitters across
the illuminated edge of the Horsehead nebula and especially their survival and
properties in the HII region. We present spectral mapping observations taken
with the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) at wavelengths 5.2-38 microns. A strong
AIB at 11.3 microns is detected in the HII region, relative to the other AIBs
at 6.2, 7.7 and 8.6 microns. The intensity of this band appears to be
correlated with the intensity of the [NeII] at 12.8 microns and of Halpha,
which shows that the emitters of the 11.3 microns band are located in the
ionised gas. The survival of PAHs in the HII region could be due to the
moderate intensity of the radiation field (G0 about 100) and the lack of
photons with energy above about 25eV. The enhancement of the intensity of the
11.3 microns band in the HII region, relative to the other AIBs can be
explained by the presence of neutral PAHs. Our observations highlight a
transition region between ionised and neutral PAHs observed with ideal
conditions in our Galaxy. A scenario where PAHs can survive in HII regions and
be significantly neutral could explain the detection of a prominent 11.3
microns band in other Spitzer observations.

"The authors present an interesting approach to combine two popular reinforcement learning algorithms, namely Policy Gradient (PG) with Deep-Q Learning(DQL). The main idea is that PG can be used as a critic in DQN which leads to faster convergence of training process.
However there are some issues I would like to point out. 

First issue concerns about how to use PG algorithm efficiently when it comes to continuous action space problems such as robotics control or autonomous driving.  In this case we need to define a good representation of actions so that they could be easily learned by neural network model. This problem has been studied extensively but still remains unsolved. 
Second one is related to exploration strategy adopted in their work. They adopt -greedy method where agent chooses random action from all possible ones at each step during training phase. However if you look closely into Figure 1 , you will find that most of time agents choose same action repeatedly even though they have different policies. It seems that -greedy does not help much on exploring new state-action pairs compared to other methods e.g., Softmax based Exploration Strategy"	1
Investing in companies and making them profitable through restructuring, management changes etc.. They are also involved with private equity funds which invests in companies that need capital to expand or restructure their business operations. The company is not publicly traded so it doesn't have shareholders who receive dividends from its investments but rather investors who buy shares of stock at an initial public offering price when they want out of the investment.  It makes money by charging fees on these transactions as well as managing the fund itself. Investors can sell back their shares if desired after the IPO has been completed. Charging fees on transactions such as buying stocks and bonds. Managing the fund itself. Selling shares of stock once it's made enough profitability. Initial Public Offerings(IPOs).

"In sumo wrestling, a kanreki dohyō-iri (Japanese: 還暦土俵入り) is a ring-entering ceremony (dohyō-iri) performed by a former yokozuna in celebration of his 60th birthday (called kanreki in Japanese). If he is a toshiyori (a sumo elder), the ceremony is usually held at the Ryōgoku Kokugikan, the main sumo hall in Tokyo. Those who are not current members of the Japan Sumo Association must hold it at another location. A special red tsuna is created and worn, instead of the usual white tsuna. Reaching your 60th birthday is an important occasion in Japan and is celebrated by wearing a red item. This is commonly known as an akatsuna (赤綱) but this term is unofficial. If the dew-sweeper or sword-bearer is a former yokozuna, he wears his own tsuna.

Kanreki performed at Kokugikan

Wrestlers are listed using their ring name, followed by their then toshiyori name in brackets if they were retired at the time of the ceremony.

Kanreki performed at other locations

Tachiyama's was the first kanreki-dohyo-iri and the only one to use the shiranui style until Asahifuji's in 2021. Mienoumi performed an early kanreki dohyō-iri seven months before his 60th birthday, on the 25th anniversary of the founding of Musashigawa stable.

Other eligible Yokozuna
Minanogawa Tōzō, Akinoumi Setsuo and Wajima Hiroshi also reached the age of sixty years whilst retired, but did not perform a kanreki dohyō-iri (all three had left the sumo world many years before). Kagamisato Kiyoji (Tatsutagawa), Tochinoumi Teruyoshi (Kasugano), Sadanoyama Shinmatsu (Sakaigawa) and Kotozakura Masakatsu (Sadogatake) received red tsuna but did not perform dohyō-iri. Kagamisato and Kotozakura did not perform due to poor health. Similarly Tochinoumi did not perform due to muscle problems in his right arm dating back to his active days. Sadanoyama declined because at the time he had just lost the chairmanship of the Sumo Association in controversial circumstances. Asashio Tarō (Takasago) had a red tsuna made, but died aged 58 without performing the ceremony.

Asahifuji was scheduled to perform the kanreki ceremony on 30 May 2020 but the event was postponed owing to the COVID-19 Pandemic. It was eventually held on 3 October 2021 at the Kokugikan.

The statistical mechanics of time-independent non-dissipative nonequilibrium states is studied in the framework of generalized entropy production and fluctuation theorem. The main results are formulated for systems with discrete energy levels, but they can be extended to continuous spectrum as well. It is shown that the probability distribution function (PDF) of the total entropy production has an exponential tail at large values of entropy production. This result agrees with recent experimental data on PDFs of heat fluxes between two reservoirs connected by a single molecule junction. In addition it is demonstrated how this approach allows one to calculate the average value of the total entropy production and its fluctuations. Finally we discuss possible applications of these results to transport phenomena in molecular junctions. We show that our theory predicts correctly the dependence of the current-voltage characteristics on temperature difference between the leads. Statistical mechanics of time independent non-dissipative non-equilibrium states is studied within the framework of generalized entropy-production and fluctuation theorem. Main results are formulated for systems having discrete energy-levels, however extension to continuum spectra is also discussed.

"The article is very interesting and well written, but I have some comments on it.
1) The authors should make clear that they are not proposing to use neural networks in place of conventional programming languages.  They propose using them as an alternative way of expressing programs (and perhaps also data). This may be clearer if you change your title from Neural Networking to something like ""Neurally Expressed Programs"" or ""Programming with Neurons"". 
2) In Figure 1 , there seems to be no connection between neurons A and B; this could lead readers astray into thinking that these two neurons do not communicate at all.   It would help clarify things greatly if you added arrows connecting neuron A to neuron B. (This comment applies only to Figs. 2-5.)"	1

We present an analysis of the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS) Galactic Cluster Survey data for the open cluster, Pleiades. We use this to derive the number ratio between binaries and single stars in the range 0.1 < M/M⊙ < 1.0 as well as the initial mass function (IMF). The results are compared against previous studies using different techniques. Our derived binary fraction is consistent within uncertainties with that found by other authors but our IMF shows significant differences when compared to previous work. These discrepancies may be due to contamination from background galaxies or unresolved multiple systems which have been included in previous analyses. This study highlights the importance of accurate photometry over large areas combined with high resolution spectroscopy to fully understand the properties of young open clusters such as the Pleiades.

"This paper proposes an interesting idea for rapidly adapting generative models in the low data regime. The idea is to use similar techniques that are used in one-shot learning, specifically ideas from matching networks. To that end, the authors propose the generative matching networks model, which is effectively a variational auto-encoder that can be conditioned on an input dataset. Given a query point, the model matches the query point to points in the conditioning set using an attention model in an embedding space (this is similar to matching networks). The results on the Omniglot dataset show that this method is successfully able to rapidly adapt to new input distributions given few examples.

I think that the method is very interesting, however the major issue for me with this paper is a lack of clarity. I outline more details below, but overall I found the paper somewhat difficult to follow. There are a lot of details that I feel are scattered throughout, and I did not get a sense after reading this paper that I would be able to implement the method and replicate the results. My suggestion is to consolidate the major implementation details into a single section, and be explicit about the functional form of the different embedding functions and their variants.

I was a bit disappointed to see that weak supervision in the form of labels had to be used. How does the method perform in a completely unsupervised setting? This could be an interesting baseline.

There is a lack of definition of the different functions. Some basic insight into the functional forms of f, g, \phi, sim and R would be nice. Otherwise it is very unclear to me what’s going on.

Section 3.2: “only state of the recurrent controller was used for matching”, my reading of this section (after several passes) is that the pseudo-input is used in the place of a regular input. Is this correct? Otherwise, this sentence/section needs more clarification. I noticed upon further reading in section 4.2 that there are two versions of the model: one in which a pseudo input is used, and one in which a pseudo input is not used (the conditional version). What is the difference in functional form between these? That is, how do the formulas for the embeddings f and g change between these settings?

“since the result was fully contrastive we did not apply any further binarization” what does it mean for a result to be fully contrastive?

For clarity, the figures and table refer to the number of shots, but this is never defined. I assume this is T here. This should be made consistent.

Figure 2: why is the value of T only 9 in this case? What does it mean for it to be 0? It is stated earlier that T should go up to 20 (I assume #shot corresponds to T). It also looks like the results continue to improve with an increased number of steps, I would like to see the results for 5 and maybe 6 steps as well. Presumably there will come a point where you get diminishing returns.

Table 1: is the VAE a fair baseline? You mention that Ctest affects Pd() in the evaluation. The fact that the VAE does not have an associated Ctest implies that the two models are being evaluated with a different metric. Can the authors clarify this? It’s important that the comparison is apples-to-apples.

MNIST is much more common than Omniglot for evaluating generative models. Would it be possible to perform similar experiments on this dataset? That way it can be compared with many more models.

Further, why are the negative log-likelihood values monotonically decreasing in the number of shots? That is, is there ever a case where increasing the number of shots can hurt things? What happens at T=30? 40?

As a minor grammatical issue, the paper is missing determiners in several sentences. At one point, the model is referred to as “she” instead of “it”. “On figure 3” should be changed to “in figure 3” in the experiments section.

"The Sand Hills region of the Upper Midwest United States is known as one of America's most distinctive architectural regions, and its vernacular style has been called ""the American Gothic Revival in stone.""The area's unique geography—a series of rolling hills covered by sandy soil that was ideal for building houses out of native limestone or brick—the presence of nearby quarries supplying these materials at low cost, and the availability of wood from local forests all contributed to this regionalism.
In addition to their use of locally available resources, builders also incorporated elements of other styles popular during the 19th century such as Greek revival, Italianate, Queen Anne, Colonial Revival, Victorian, Prairie School (or prairie-style), and Art Deco into their designs.  The result is a collection of buildings whose appearance varies widely but which share certain common characteristics including steeply pitched roofs, projecting gables, decorative trim work on doors and windows, large porches supported by brackets, and chimneys often built into the eaves."	1

The new reactor is based on the principle that nuclear fusion can be achieved by heating plasma to high temperatures in magnetic fields.  The proposed design uses an array of magnets and electrodes, which are powered by microwave generators, to heat hydrogen gas into plasma at 100 million degrees Celsius (1,000,000 K). This temperature is sufficient to cause nuclear fusion reactions between deuterium nuclei inside the plasma. In this way, energy is released as neutrons and gamma rays. These particles then bombard fuel pellets made up of tritium and lithium-6, causing them to release more energy through further nuclear fusion reactions. The resulting power plant would produce electrical power with no moving parts or radioactive waste products. It could also provide propulsion systems for spacecraft without requiring any chemical fuels. A conceptual drawing of the reactor system is shown below. Nuclear fusion has been studied extensively since its discovery over 50 years ago. However, it remains elusive because the conditions required to achieve fusion are extremely difficult to create experimentally.	1
"The following steps can be taken by anyone who wants to compose original songs.  The first step towards becoming a composer would be learning how to play any kind of instruments such as:  Piano Guitar Violin Cello Flute Saxophone Trombone Clarinet Upright bass Drums Once you've learned some basic skills on these instruments you'll need to start listening closely to what they do when played individually.   This means paying attention to:   How does each note feel? What sort of moods does this particular instrument create?  Does it seem happy? Sad? Angry?
Once you're able to hear individual notes clearly it's time to move onto hearing patterns within those notes - which we call ""scales"".  Scales are simply groups of notes arranged into ascending order from lowest pitched tone to highest.  Learning different types... Continue reading →

"Heaven Cent is a fantasy novel by American writer Piers Anthony, the eleventh book of the Xanth series.  It is the second book of a trilogy beginning with Vale of the Vole and ending with Man from Mundania.

Plot introduction
The protagonist of Heaven Cent is Prince Dolph, shapeshifting son of King Dor and Queen Irene and younger brother of Princess Ivy.  The story begins with Dolph, a pre-teen, setting out on a Quest with his designated Adult Companion Marrow Bones to locate the magician Humfrey, who had been missing since Vale of the Vole.

Plot summary

The story begins with Prince Dolph lying in his sister, Ivy's, bed watching her magical tapestry which shows images from the past and present of Xanth. Dolph is the son of King Dor and Queen Irene, and he has the powerful talent of being able to shapeshift, giving him the power to change into any animal he chooses. While watching the images of the magical tapestry Dolph begins to think about the disappearance of the Good Magician Humphrey. Dolph gets so enraptured with the thought of finding the Magician that he eventually asks his father and mother permission to set out on a quest to find the answers. Queen Irene decides that Dolph is at a fine age to set out for a quest, but as long as he takes with him an adult companion. After some debate and arguing over who should accompany Dolph, Dolph suggests that Marrow Bones accompany him. Marrow is a walking, talking skeleton who has the ability to transform his skeletal body into many shapes as long as Dolph gives him a good kick in the tail bone first.

Once Dolph and Marrow set out on their journey they realize their first stop must be at the Good Magician Humfrey's castle to investigate for any clues to his disappearance. Once in the castle Dolph and Marrow find a hidden room that can only be viewed through a clear rock from above. In the hidden room is a message that reads ""Skeleton Key to Heaven Cent"". Marrow distinguishes that there is a pun in the message, and a Skeleton Key is really an island made of coral. So Dolph and Marrow set out to find the isle and find the Heaven Cent to bring back the Good Magician Humphrey.

Throughout Dolph and Marrow's adventures through the land of Xanth they encounter many different creatures. There are the always rhyming ogres, bone hungry and smelly harpies, the cruel merwomen, and many others. One of the major creatures that come into play in the book are the nagas. The nagas are a snake-human people who have the power to transform into either a full snake, full human, or mixed form. Dolph and Marrow encounter the nagas when trying to get through a goblin kingdom where the goblins are holding Nada, the naga princess, prisoner. After rescuing Nada, Dolph and Marrow return to the naga kingdom, where Dolph, even though too young, becomes unintentionally betrothed to Nada through a naga tradition. Nada joins Dolph and Marrow on their quest to find the Heaven Cent, and their romantic relationship blossoms until Nada reveals to Dolph that she is actually many years older than he is. Although Dolph is taken aback by this information, his love for Nada does not waver and he keeps the betrothal intact.

When Dolph, Marrow, and Nada finally find the right island where the Heaven Cent is supposed to be they encounter a magical castle where a maiden has been under a magical sleep for 900 years of a 1000-year sentence. The sleeping maiden is named Electra, and she was put under the sleeping spell because 900 years ago she accidentally activated the Heaven Cent. Dolph kisses the sleeping Electra and awakens her, but to Dolph's surprise Electra cannot survive unless she marries the person who broke the spell on her.

Once the entire party returns to Castle Roogna Dolph is left with the decision about what to do with his two betrothed women. After much debate with both women and the King and Queen, Dolph asks for the test of the roses. Dolph chooses the yellow rose for Electra showing friendship and the red rose for Nada representing love. Electra is the first of the betrothed to attempt the test and she quickly chooses the red rose for Dolph representing love. Nada goes second and tries to pick the red rose, but she cannot because she does not truly love him and she is pricked by a rose. Nada then tries to pick a black rose and commit suicide, but Dolph jumps over to her and stops her. Dolph explains that he loves Nada even though the love is not returned. In the end Dolph remains betrothed to each girl even though the King and Queen do not believe in it, but Dolph and the girls believe that, in the next seven years before Dolph can marry, they will work out all the problems.

The Test of the Roses
The test of the roses is when one person stands in the center of a garden of different colored roses. Each rose color stands for a different emotion: white for indifference, yellow for friendship, pink for romance, red for love, and black for death. The person being decided over stands on a pillar in the middle of the garden, then the person trying to show their emotions walks around the garden and picks the appropriate colored rose for how they feel about the person in the middle of the garden.

"We study the non-equilibrium evolution of an interacting onedimensional Bose gas initially prepared in a coherent state with finite particle number fluctuations and show that it exhibits universal features, which are independent of microscopic details such as interactions or initial conditions. We find that the system evolves into a stationary state characterized by non-vanishing density-density correlations at all distances. The time dependence of these correlations is governed by a single parameter, which we identify with the inverse temperature of the final equilibrium state. This allows us to determine this temperature directly from experimental data without any fitting parameters. Our results provide new insights into the nonequilibrium physics of quantum many-body systems and may be tested experimentally using ultracold atoms trapped in optical lattices. 
I. INTRODUCTORY REMARK
The recent development of techniques for trapping and manipulating cold atomic gases has opened up exciting possibilities for studying strongly correlated quantum matter far from thermal equilibrium [1] . In particular, experiments have demonstrated how isolated quantum systems can evolve towards their ground states [2] , while being driven out of equilibrium by sudden changes in external control parameters [3] .
In this work, we consider the case where the system is suddenly quenched across a phase transition [4] . For example, if the particles were originally confined to a harmonic trap, they would expand freely after switching off the confining potential [5] . Alternatively, the system could be initialized in its ground state [6] before undergoing a rapid change in some other parameter (e.g., magnetic field) [7, 8] . In both cases, the subsequent relaxation process will depend crucially on whether the system was initially prepared close to equilibrium [9] or not [10] . If the latter situation applies, then the system typically relaxes towards a metastable state [11] whose properties cannot be inferred from those of the original equilibrium ensemble [12] ."	1
"Joseph H. Allen (September 5, 1821 – April 24, 1884) was an industrial businessman, an officer in the Civil War, and a town supervisor of Brunswick, New York. Allen was born in Alburg, Vermont, to parents of British descent and left home at an early age. After several business ventures, he became successful in the auger and hoe business, selling mainly to the American South. He successfully ran for supervisor of the Town of Brunswick in 1856 and justice of the peace in 1861. At the beginning of the Civil War, his sales plummeted so he closed his business and enlisted in the Union Army. Allen was wounded multiple times during his service and ended his career at the rank of lieutenant colonel. He returned home to reopen his factory, which was instrumental to the industrial success of the hamlet of Eagle Mills in the mid to late 19th century. He died in 1884 at the age of 62.

Early life
Allen was the son of John and Sarah Allen. His father was a native of Connecticut and of English origin, and his mother was originally from Vermont and of Scottish descent. He left home when he was eight years old ""to carve out a fortune for himself"", as Sylvester put it in his History of Rensselaer County, New York. He began work in an auger factory in Hamden, Connecticut, at an early age and continued until he was seventeen years old. At that time, he purchased a clock store, which he traded for horses in Vermont and Canada. He shipped his horses to the West Indies, but the ship was wrecked and his horses were lost, thus placing him badly in debt. However, he soon obtained credit, and again shipped a number of horses to the West Indies, this time successfully, enabling him to pay all his debts and even earning him a profit.

Before the war
Allen soon resumed his place in the auger factory in Connecticut, where he remained until September 1, 1843, when he moved to Troy, New York. There he entered into partnership with O. W. Edson in manufacturing augers. The partnership continued until the following January when Allen purchased his partner's share and continued in this business until the factory burned down in 1850.

In January 1851, Allen purchased the Eagle flour mills, an historically important industrial building in the area, which eventually gave the hamlet of Eagle Mills its name. The factory had a long history of failed business attempts. It was built in 1821 by Daniel Sheldon to mill flour using wheat supplied from Troy. After brief success, the business closed and the building sat idle. It was sold to James Bumstead who reopened the building as a feed mill. He too had troubles and sold the building to James McChesney, who kept the building idle for some time before transferring the property to Catlin and Saxton, who began the manufacture of augers and bits. Also unsuccessful, Catlin and Saxton abandoned the business and James McChesney (whose name was still on the deed) sold the property to Groome and Shattuck, who began manufacturing monkey wrenches. This too failed and the property was sold to Paul Smith, a miller from nearby Cropseyville, who sold the property to Allen in 1851 because Smith later decided that he preferred to keep his mills consolidated in Cropseyville.

The factory was located on the rocky banks of the Poesten Kill, a creek that was commonly used for water power in the area. Allen had two new buildings erected and funneled creek water to them through tunnels in the bedrock underneath the buildings. He named his enterprise the Millville Manufacturing Company and converted the mill into an auger and bit factory. At one point, he experimented with producing cable chains and files, as well. But the company soon ran into legal difficulties and was dissolved.

Allen reopened the company in 1859, having added machinery for the manufacture of hoes, and opened a retail store on site. He found a successful market in the South, where demand was high. His company, newly named the Planters' Hoe Company, was a considerable success. However, as the nation came closer to civil war, demand dropped and sales in the South became impossible. The factory was closed in 1861, not only due to poor sales, but because Allen enlisted in the Union Army.

Public and armed service

Allen's presence was noticeable within Brunswick. In March 1853, he presided over a meeting to incorporate the ""Church of the Disciples of Christ at the village of Millville"", now known simply as Church of the Disciples of Christ. That summer, a church building was erected at a cost of about $1,200. In 1856 Allen became the supervisor of Brunswick, a position he was reelected to once and held until 1857; he ran as a Whig. He was also elected justice of the peace in 1861, but he did not finish his term because he decided to serve in the Civil War; this time he ran as a Democrat, and remained one for the rest of his life.

In early 1862, the 125th Volunteer Infantry Regiment had been put together in Brunswick and a call by President Lincoln for more troops was answered by Allen that September. He enlisted in Company C of the 169th New York Volunteer Infantry and was chosen captain, having organized the company within six days. Most of the infantrymen came from Brunswick, though some came from surrounding towns. Residents of the town raised the money necessary to cover various ""bounties and expenses"" incurred by Allen's soldiers while en route to war.

Allen participated in all the battles in which his regiment took part except a few minor ones, due to wounds he received in battle. During the Battle of Cold Harbor, the bones in his wrist were shattered, and he later incurred a flesh wound in the same wrist at the First Battle of Fort Fisher. He was also wounded in the leg near his ankle at Fort Fisher; the musket ball remained there until his death. While recovering from injuries, he was reassigned to New York to recruit new soldiers. He was promoted to the rank of major in June 1864, and, for ""meritorious conduct"" at Fort Fisher, he was recommended for promotion by President Lincoln and brevetted lieutenant colonel on March 13, 1865.

Post war and personal life
Allen returned to Brunswick after the war and reopened the Planters' Hoe Company in association with George T. Lane. He ended the production of augers, which still made up a small percentage of production even after closing Millville Manufacturing. Allen put himself in charge of manufacturing and sales and he again secured a solid market share in the South. A prosperous trade resumed and was still strong at least until the 1880s. The company eventually expanded and began manufacturing lighter common hoes for the general public, adding to its heavy southern-style line of hoes. The Planters' Hoe Company was still a success as late as the 1890s, but it was extinct by the 1920s.

In addition to holding the offices of justice of the peace and town supervisor, it is also said that Allen was one of the foremost supporters of education in the town. On July 6, 1847, he married Sarah H. Payne, daughter of David H. and Catharine C. Payne, of Hamden, Connecticut. The couple had two children: Sarah and Cornelia May.

Allen died on April 24, 1884, and is buried in Eagle Mills Cemetery on Brunswick Road in Eagle Mills; his wife died in 1907 and is buried next to him. Based on insignia carved on his gravestone (specifically the Square and Compasses), Allen was a Mason.

Notes

a.  In New York, a town supervisor is viewed by many to be equivalent to a mayor, but a supervisor is actually the presiding officer of the town council and is therefore part of the legislative branch; town governments in New York do not have an executive branch.
b.  Eagle Mills is a hamlet (a small, unincorporated settlement) in the Town of Brunswick. It was previously known as Milltown and later Millville; both of these names are now defunct, though ""Milltown"" was hardly used to begin with.

"  Fluids in which the interparticle potential has a hard core, is attractive at
moderate separations, and repulsive at greater separations are known to exhibit
novel phase behavior, including stable inhomogeneous phases. Here we report a
joint simulation and theoretical study of such a fluid, focusing on the
relationship between the liquid-vapor transition line and any new phases. The
phase diagram is studied as a function of the amplitude of the attraction for a
certain fixed amplitude of the long ranged repulsion. We find that the effect
of the repulsion is to substitute the liquid-vapor critical point and a portion
of the associated liquid-vapor transition line, by two first order transitions.
One of these transitions separates the vapor from a fluid of spherical
liquidlike clusters; the other separates the liquid from a fluid of spherical
voids. At low temperature, the two transition lines intersect one another and a
vapor-liquid transition line at a triple point. While most integral equation
theories are unable to describe the new phase transitions, the Percus Yevick
approximation does succeed in capturing the vapor-cluster transition, as well
as aspects of the structure of the cluster fluid, in reasonable agreement with
the simulation results.

"This paper addresses the practical problem of generating rare or unseen words in the context of language modeling. Since language follows a Zipf’s law, most approaches limit the vocabulary (because of computation reasons) and hence rare words are often mapped to a UNK token. Rare words are especially important in context of applications such as question answering. MT etc. This paper proposes a language modeling technique which incorporates facts from knowledge bases (KBs) and thus has the ability to generate (potentially unseen) words from KBs. This paper also releases a dataset by aligning words with Freebase facts and corresponding Wikipedia descriptions.

The model first selects a KB fact based on the previously generated words and facts. Based on the selected fact, it then predicts whether to generate a word based on the vocabulary or to output a symbolic word from the KB. For the latter, the model is trained to predict the position of the word from the fact description.

Overall the paper could use some rewriting especially the notations in section 3. The experiments are well executed and they definitely get good results. The heat maps at the end are very insightful. 

Comments

This contributions of this paper would be much stronger if it showed improvements in a practical applications such as Question Answering (although the paper clearly mentions that this technique could be applied to improve QA)
In section 3, it is unclear why the authors refer the entity as a ‘topic'. This makes the text a little confusing since a topic can also be associated with something abstract, but in this case the topic is always a freebase entity. 
Is it really necessary to predict a fact at every step before generating a word. In other words, how many distinct facts on average does the model choose to generate a sentence. Intuitively a natural language sentence would be describe few facts about an entity. If the fact generation step could be avoided (by adding a latent variable which decides if the fact should be generated or not), the model will also be faster.
In equation 2, the model has to make a hard decision to choose the fact. For this to be end to end trained, every word needs to be annotated with a corresponding fact which might not be always a realistic scenario. For e.g., in domains such as social media text.
Learning position embeddings for copying knowledge words seems a little counter-intuitive. Does the sequence of knowledge words follow any particular structure like word O_2 is always the last name (e.g. Obama).
It would also be nice to compare to char-level LM's which inherently solves the unknown token problem."	0
"The authors did not bother responding or fixing any of the pre-review comments. Hence I repeat here:

Please do not make incredibly unscientific statements like this one:
""The working procedure of this model is just like how we human beings read a text and then answer a related question. ""
Really, ""humans beings"" have an LSTM like model to read a text? Can you cite an actual neuroscience paper for such a claim? The answer is no, so please delete such statements from future drafts.

Generally, your experiments are about simple classification and the methods you're competing against are simple models like NB-SVM. So I would change the title, abstract ad introduction accordingly and not attempt hyperbole like ""Learning to Understand"" in the title.

Lastly, your attention level approach seems similar to dynamic memory networks by Kumar et al. they also have experiments for sentiment and it would be interesting to understand the differences to your model and compare to them.

Other reviewers included further missing related work and fitting this paper into the context of current literature.
Given that no efforts were made to fix the pre-review questions and feedback, I doubt this will become ready in time for publication."	0
Laughing involves rapid, shallow breathing and sudden contractions of muscles in your abdomen, chest, face, neck, shoulders, arms, hands, legs, feet, buttocks, diaphragm, tongue, larynx (voice box), throat, eyes, and ears.  Laughter can be caused by something funny or amusing that you see/hear/say/touch/have done to yourself. It also releases endorphins which are natural painkillers into our bodies so we feel good afterward. laughter is contagious too! when someone laughs they tend to make others around them smile/laugh as well because it's such an infectious thing to do. It's very healthy if used correctly but not at all healthy if overdone. Laughter increases blood flow throughout the body including the brain helping us think more clearly and remember things better. Laughter helps relieve stress and anxiety.	1
The paper addresses the problem of learning compact binary data representations. I have a hard time understanding the setting and the writing of the paper is not making it any easier. For example I can't find a simple explanation of the problem and I am not familiar with these line of research. I read all the responses provided by authors to reviewer's questions and re-read the paper again and I still do not fully understand the setting and thus can't really evaluate the contributions of these work. The related work section does not exist and instead the analysis of the literature is somehow scattered across the paper. There are no derivations provided. Statements often miss references, e.g. the ones in the fourth paragraph of Section 3. This makes me conclude that the paper still requires significant work before it can be published.	0
The United States has had only one written constitution since its founding in 1776 and it was ratified by all states at once unlike many others that have been amended over time or replaced entirely with new ones. The US constitution also contains more guarantees of individual rights than most modern constitutions do today which makes it even less likely to be changed often. It is considered sacrosanct because there are few countries who can say they haven't made changes to their own constitution throughout history. Most people don't realize how unique this document really is when compared to any other nation's constitution around the world. There aren't very many countries where you could find someone willing to die defending what our constitution says as if it's God's word. Because we have never needed to make amendments to it (and hopefully won't ever) and because it protects us from government tyranny better than anything else on earth. We have only had 1 written constitution since 1776	1
We report on an analysis of archival Chandra data for the central region of the nearby starburst galaxy M82 (NGC 3034). We find that there are two bright, point-like sources in this field which have been previously identified as ULXs (Ultra-Luminous X-Ray Sources) by Swartz et al. (2004) . The first source is located at RA = 12 h 54 m 55 s .6 and Dec = 69°59'45'' with a count rate of 1.1 x 10^-3 counts sec-1. This source has a luminosity of 2 x 10^39 erg/sec assuming it lies at 8 kpc distance. The second source is located at RA=12h54m55s.7 and Dec=69°59'46'' with a count rate 0.9 x 10^-3 countssec-1. It also has a luminosity of about 2 x 10^39erg/sec if it lies at 8kpc. Both these sources appear to be variable over timescales ranging between hours and days.  These results suggest that both sources may contain black holes accreting close to their Eddington limit.	1
"Weak gravitational lensing is an important tool to study dark matter halos in galaxy clusters, but it requires large telescopes or space-based observatories with high angular resolution cameras. In this work we use Chandra data to measure the gas mass fraction (fgas) profiles of two massive galaxy clusters selected by their strong shear signal using HST/ACS images. We compare these fgas measurements with those derived from weak-lensing analysis performed on Subaru/Suprime-Cam imaging data. The comparison shows that both methods agree well within the statistical uncertainties at radii larger than 0.5 r500. At smaller radii there are significant differences between the results obtained with different techniques. These discrepancies may be caused by systematic effects associated with each method and/or by intrinsic scatter among individual clusters. This project was supported by NASA grant NNX10AD65G. We thank J. Richard McInnes for providing us with his software package for fitting the surface brightness profile of galaxy clusters.

"The authors present SGDR (Stochastic Gradient Descent with Randomized Restart) which improves upon standard SGD using randomized partial warm restarts.
They show that their method outperforms other methods such as Adam, RMSprop, AdaGrad etc., especially if one wants an algorithm that can be stopped after some time without compromising accuracy too much.  The experiments were performed on several different data sets including MNIST, CIFAR10/100, EEG-data-set and down-scaled versions of Imagenet. 
I think it would have been interesting to see how well SGDR performs compared to more recent algorithms like ADADELTA but I guess there was no point since they already beat all these older ones? Overall it's very nice work!"	1
"  In this paper we present a novel framework for sequence to shape maps. These
combinatorial maps realize exponentially many shapes, and have preimages which
contain extended connected subgraphs of diameter n (neutral networks). We prove
that all basic properties of RNA folding maps also hold for combinatorial maps.
Our construction is as follows: suppose we are given a graph $H$ over the $\{1
>...,n\}$ and an alphabet of nucleotides together with a symmetric relation
$\mathcal{R}$, implied by base pairing rules. Then the shape of a sequence of
length n is the maximal H subgraph in which all pairs of nucleotides incident
to H-edges satisfy $\mathcal{R}$. Our main result is to prove the existence of
at least $\sqrt{2}^{n-1}$ shapes with extended neutral networks, i.e. shapes
that have a preimage with diameter $n$ and a connected component of size at
least $(\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2})^n+(\frac{1-\sqrt{5}}{2})^n$. Furthermore, we show
that there exists a certain subset of shapes which carries a natural graph
structure. In this graph any two shapes are connected by a path of shapes with
respective neutral networks of distance one. We finally discuss our results and
provide a comparison with RNA folding maps.

"The Director of a film (or a play, or a television show episode) is the person responsible for the creative vision of the piece. They create a concept from the script (which may or may not be something concretely found in the script, it may be metaphorical or tangential) and from the concept lead the design and production team towards a collaborative vision. Once rehearsals/filming have begin, the director blocks the piece (i.e. tells actors where to move), provides objective and subtextual support to the actors (i.e. tells them why they are saying the things the writer wrote) and ensures that the visual style and setting are within the original vision or concept parameters.

In film, they also work closely with the DP, first story-boarding the script, and then, once on set, making sure that each shoot is framed, blocked and shot per their vision. Including ALL design aspects, from the color of the walls to the type of purse a character might wear.

In essence they are the Captain of the ship. A lot of my notes below can also be laid at the feet of bad writing, but in film (less so TV and theatre) directors have a great deal of oversight on the writing, so they are typically held accountable if the writing is terrible.

A film which has been directed badly will usually (but not always, the problem with a collaborative art form, which is what film is, is that there are many, many chefs in the kitchen. However, since the director tends to get the credit when everything works, they also tend to get the blame when it doesn't)--usually show the following flaws:

1. Incoherent story telling. You don't know what is happening. Or why it is happening. Or who it is happening to. Sometimes things are just blatantly implausible.

2. Cliche or trope ridden dialogue/shots/events. You feel like you've seen all of these things before. All the characters are stereotypes, all the plot points unfailingly predictable. Note: cliches, tropes and stereotypes can all be used well. But bad directors tend not to.

3. Bad dialogue. Dialogue that is forced and unnatural. Dialogue that is too on-the-nose. People telling other people things instead of doing things. People explaining how they feel ad nauseam. Dialogue spoken only to allow for the plot to push forward, leading us to:

4. Coincidental plotting, or plots hole you could drive a freight train through (not the small inconsistencies that almost every movie has, but HUGE giant massive oh-my-god-this-movie-is-broken plot holes). Coincidental plotting is when everything that has to happen for the plot to move forward does, without any effort on the part of the hero (or the bad guy).

5. Bad acting. Directors are responsible for getting a performance out of their actors, so even if the actor can't act (one reason why casting is important) the director is still the one people are going to hold responsible for any painful moments on screen (this is less true in TV and theatre). 

6. Over or under designed. Over designed is when the concept/vision of the piece becomes more important then any other element. Think 300: Rise of an Empire or Sin City: A Dame to Kill For (not-at-all-oddly, both Frank Miller graphic novel adaptations, where the look was where the design team started with). Tim Burton is also a well-known director who can go to far with his vision/design to the point of over balancing the movie. Under designing is when there is a lack of design and the production feels (usually) cheap or not-thought-through. Good design elevates the narrative, supports the characters and provides visual clues to the audience about what is happening--excellent design can comment on and complement the action, enhancing the entire experience.

7. Movies/TV only: bad editing. Either because there were technical difficulties during filming and the needed shots weren't gotten (or a director wasn't prepared and didn't get the shots they needed), and therefore the editor is attempting to make up for missing and/or bad shots; or because the editing itself is just bad. Odd cuts, odd shots going back to back, odd audio issues. Various other things.  While most early directors at a studio on a movie won't have any say over the final cut, most editing issues are from a lack of footage (which is the director's issue), not bad editing. OR a director who does have final cut approval and shouldn't, which is where you got a three-hour movie that should have been 2 hours and 10 minutes max.

8. Poor production value. An overall feel that the movie wasn't cared for (this isn't about money, this is about time and support). Usually shows in bad lighting, bad audio, bad set dressing, bad costumes--just an overall sense that these things weren't considered important or there wasn't time to pay attention to them.

A film, tv show or theatrical play is an immense, multi-part beast, and the Director is the one that tries to tame it. To varying degrees of success. Every director probably has one (or many) bad movies to their name, as its how we all learn. The more telling test is not if they directed a bad movie, but if people wanted to work with them again. And, sometimes, the love of the thing they are creating can shine through the worst movie and make it, somehow, good (think Sam Raimi's original Evil Dead).

"The 1975 Fiesta Bowl was the fifth edition of the college football bowl game, played at Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe, Arizona on Friday, December 26. Part of the 1975–76 bowl game season, it matched the sixth-ranked Nebraska Cornhuskers of the Big Eight Conference and the undefeated #7 Arizona State Sun Devils of the Western Athletic Conference (WAC). The underdog Sun Devils won, 17–14.

Played at ASU's home venue, this was the Fiesta Bowl's first matchup between teams ranked in the top ten; the next was six years later.

Teams

Nebraska

The Cornhuskers won their first ten games of the season and climbed to second in the AP poll; they were set up for a Big Eight title and potential national championship until a fourth consecutive loss to rival Oklahoma on November 22. This was Nebraska's first appearance in the Fiesta Bowl; the Huskers had won their previous six bowl games, and the last five were major bowls.

Arizona State

The Sun Devils won all eleven games in the regular season to take their fifth WAC title in six years; it was their fourth Fiesta Bowl appearance in five years.

Game summary
The game kicked off shortly after 1 p.m. MST, following the Sun Bowl, both televised by  CBS.

Placekicker Danny Kush started and ended the scoring in this game that arguably put the Fiesta Bowl on the map. He gave ASU an early lead in the first quarter, but I-back Monte Anthony gave Nebraska the lead in the second quarter with his one-yard touchdown run. With less than a minute remaining in the half, the Sun Devils drove down the field and narrowed the lead to a point with another Kush field goal.

Anthony scored another touchdown in the third quarter to extend Nebraska's lead to  Wide receiver John Jefferson caught a ten-yard touchdown pass from backup quarterback Fred Mortensen, who had taken over after sophomore starter Dennis Sproul was briefly hurt on a successful sneak on fourth down at the Nebraska thirteen to extend the drive. Head coach Frank Kush opted for a two-point conversion attempt, and wingback Larry Mucker caught a pass from Mortensen at the end zone's left edge to tie the game at fourteen early in the final quarter.

Nebraska punted twice after short drives, with Mortensen throwing an interception in between. Sproul returned at quarterback and he drove the Sun Devils down the field to the Nebraska twelve; Kush kicked a 29-yard field goal for a three-point lead with under five minutes remaining. The Huskers then got their offense going, and with just over a minute remaining, fullback Tony Davis caught a third-down pass over the middle inside the Devils' thirty. He was hit by John Harris and fumbled, ASU's Rocky Mataalli recovered, and the offense ran out the clock.

Arizona State held Nebraska scoreless in the fourth quarter to win their fourth Fiesta Bowl in as many attempts; Jefferson was named offensive MVP with eight receptions for 115 yards. Linebacker Larry Gordon was the defensive MVP, but was ejected early in the fourth quarter for fighting (along with Nebraska's consensus All-American center Rik Bonness). Nebraska led in rushing yards, but ASU outgained them in passing and total yards, had fewer turnovers, and scored just one touchdown.

Scoring
First quarter
 ASU – Danny Kush 27-yard field goal
Second quarter
 NEB – Monte Anthony 1-yard run (Mike Coyle kick)
 ASU – Kush 33-yard field goal
Third quarter
 NEB – Anthony 4-yard run (Coyle kick)

Aftermath
Arizona State (12–0) was second in the final AP poll, their best finish ever; Nebraska (10–2) dropped to ninth. ASU won another WAC title in 1977 and moved to the  in 1978. Both teams returned multiple times to the Fiesta Bowl, Nebraska five times (next in January 1986) and ASU twice (next in December 1977).

"The authors present an interesting method for reducing computational complexity during training time while maintaining high quality predictions at test-time.  They use a combination of two techniques -greedy layer-wise pruning followed by finetuning using backpropogation-that they claim is both effective and fast.
I think this work has some potential but I have several concerns about it.  

First off, there isn't much discussion as far as how these methods compare against existing state-of-the-art approaches like SqueezeNet which uses similar ideas.   It would be helpful if you could include comparisons between your technique and others such as MobileNets since you're proposing something very related.

This is because they are not actually seeing or touching something but instead feeling it in their mind's eye. The same goes with hearing; if you hear music playing somewhere far away then it's probably coming from your imagination rather than an actual source of sound.

The electrical specifications change so we can get faster data transfer rates between devices connected by these connectors/cables/plugs. The physical appearance may also be changed but this is not always necessary as long as they still fit into their sockets or slots on other devices. This will allow you to connect your computer with any device using one type of connection regardless if it was made in 2005 or 2015. It does however mean that older computers cannot communicate at high speed with newer ones unless an adapter cable is used which converts from old to new standards. Newer computers usually have adapters built in already though. The electrical specifications change so we could get faster data transfer rates betweens devices connected by these connectors /cables/plugs. Physical appearance might also be changed but it's not always needed since they should still fit inside their sockets/slots onto other devices. This way you'll be able to connect your PC with any device via just 1 kind of connection no matter when it has been created - whether back in 2005 or now in 2015. However, this means that older computers can't communicate fast enough with more recent models without having some sort of converter cable attached; converting from outdated to modern standards. More up-to-date machines often include converters built-in anyway.	1
"The authors present their new method in detail with several examples on synthetic data sets.
I think this work will have great impact especially if applied to real world problems where we are interested not only in prediction but also want to know how our model works.  I would like to see more experiments done using EQL networks trained on real-world datasets such as medical or financial ones. The code should be made available so other researchers could try out these ideas themselves. Overall very good research!

"Unions aren't some broad/nebulous construct, different ones do different things, and have different pros/cons.

**Construction Unions** represent individuals that would otherwise be treated as individual companies/contractors by major construction companies. The union negotiates standard rates/fees for various services (bricklaying, sheet-metal work, etc.) so that individual workers don't engage in a race-to-the-bottom for prices. In big cities unions will also function as a job-placement service, so that elevator repairmen/electricians/etc can spend their time doing their job instead of looking for a job. The major drawback has to do with contract negotiations and cost controls. For example, a corporation may want to build a new building in a city but is forced by the cities rules to hire a certain number of union construction crew. This reduces their flexibility in being able to hire people at a lower cost. Union construction workers also have pretty stern regulations and limitations as to what they can/can't do. Much of what the unions fought for in the latter half of the 20th century, such as workplace safety, has now been made law. However, there are a plethora of rules/regulations that can frustrate contract managers. For example, a pallet of brick-laying material may sit idle for weeks on a construction floor because only a union employee and move it or work with it.

**Teachers Unions** serve to negotiate broad/standard contracts with local school districts or school boards. They help standardize pay and benefits for all teachers, and act as a firewall against aggressive school leadership that may want to fire a teacher without cause. The downside is that most teachers unions have adopted an ""innocent until proven guilty, but still innocent anyways"" approach at protecting their members. This has frustrated many jurisdictions, most recently Washington DC. They attempted to fire a slew of teachers they considered ""bad"" for a variety of reasons, but the Union took them to court and won."	0
" Make certain to catch the three springs. Hold the mechanism together as it slides off the bar. Remove the trigger and the spring under it, too. You must have all of the following parts available to make the clamp work when it is reassembled:


The bar and two plastic retainer pins––save the pins for later. (See Tips below if these are missing.)
The end pad––save for later.
The plastic mechanism case.
The plastic ratchet handle.
The ""flat"" coil spring––this is about 2 inches long.
The leaf spring––this is about 4 inches long, flat, with and oblong hole and a bend.
A flat steel ratchet plate.
A steel ratchet plate with a hook on the end.
The steel release trigger.
The V-shaped trigger spring.;
, With the ratchet groves facing away from you, fit the plastic mechanism case over the end of the bar and slide it on, going through the hole in the end opposite the pad, through the U-shaped guide inside, and then through the trigger hole in the pad-end. If it does not slide easily, flip the bar upside down and try the other end., The ratchet groves must face the inside of the case. Let the case rock back to reveal the end of the bar.

,,  Either end can go down.,, With the pin end of the handle up, and the hook pointing up, slide the plate into the second hole in the handle such that the plate sits nearly flat against the handle end.  The hook must catch on the pin such that the hook folds over the pin and points to that end of the handle. If it points toward the open U-shaped end of the handle, it will not work.


Thread the hook-end ratchet plate and handle over the exposed end of the bar, placing your index finger on the hook to keep the plate flat to the handle end. 
Slide the handle down to the flat ratchet plate.

,

 

The first trick is to make sure the end of the bar is even with the handle opening. 
The second trick is to grab the handle with your hand, sliding your finger under the leaf spring with your thumb on top of the ratchet hook. 
Squeeze to compress the flat coil spring against the ratchet plates and handle end. 
Then slide into the space in the mechanism cover between the U-shaped guide and the trigger end. 
Push it in so that the end of the bar is visible through the trigger opening.

,


 

Place the two free legs of the trigger spring down into the cup around the trigger opening, then place the unhooked end of the trigger into the notch in the mechanism cover with the trigger hook pointing up. 
Depress the trigger slightly and slide it over the end of the bar and the entire assembly down on the bar 6 inches.

, Check that it moves the mechanism up on the bar and that the trigger must be squeezed to move the mechanism down on the bar.,"	0
The isobaric analog state (IAS) in nuclei has been studied by using the folding model with microscopic nucleon-nucleon interactions based on chiral effective field theory. The IAS was found to be sensitive to both the isoscalar and isovector parts of the nuclear matter density distribution as well as the strength of the spin-orbit interaction. In particular, it was shown that the IAS can provide useful information about the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy at subsaturation densities. It was also demonstrated that the effect of the tensor force on the IAS depends strongly on the choice of the nuclear mean-field potentials used for describing the ground-state properties of nuclei. Finally, we have discussed how one could extract the information about the nuclear symmetry energy from experimental data on the IAS in heavy nuclei. PACS numbers: 25.20.Lj, 27.60.+j, 29.40.+s	1
"  Shell model calculations for low lying energy states of neutron rich oxygen
isotopes 19O, 20O, 21O, 22O, 23O, 24O, 25O, 26O have been performed using
OXBASH code. The configuration space consists of 0d5/2, 1s1/2, 0d3/2 orbital
for neutrons outside the 16O core. Different interactions namely, Wildenthal,
Preedom-Wildenthal, Wildenthal-Mcgrory and renormalized Kuo and Brown, which
are either empirical or realistic in nature have been used in the calculation,
The calculated energy spectrum are in good agreement with the experimental data
wherever available for the empirical interactions and the correct ordering of
levels is reproduced. The levels obtained from realistic interactions, though
have a small rms deviation, do not reproduce the correct ordering in some of
the cases. In the case of 21O, realistic interactions predict a much too
compressed 1/2+ state at energy 0.157 MeV compared to the experimental value of
1.218 MeV. For even isotopes the variation of the energy of the first 2+exited
state has been studied as a function of neutron number N. A sharp rise in the
value is observed at N=16 for both empirical and realistic interactions and
only at N=14 for empirical interactions. Significantly higher energy of first
2+ exited state compared to the value in the neighboring even-even nuclei is
considered as a signature for magic nuclei at N=14 and N=16.

"Venosa (Lucano:  ) is a town and comune in the province of Potenza, in the southern Italian region of Basilicata, in the Vulture area. It is bounded by the comuni of Barile, Ginestra, Lavello, Maschito, Montemilone, Palazzo San Gervasio, Rapolla and Spinazzola.

History

Ancient
The city was known as Venusia (""City of Venus"") to the Romans, who credited its establishment—as Aphrodisia (""City of Aphrodite"")—to the Homeric hero Diomedes. He was said to have moved to Magna Graecia in southern Italy following the Trojan War, seeking a life of peace and building the town and its temples to appease the anger of Aphrodite for the destruction of her beloved Troy.

The town was taken by the Romans after the Third Samnite War in 291 BC and became a colony for its strategical position between Apulia and Lucania. No fewer than 20,000 men were sent there, owing to its military importance. Throughout the Hannibalic wars, it remained faithful to Rome, and had a further contingent of colonists sent in 200 BC to replace its losses in the war. In 190 BC the Appian way was extended to the town. Some coins of Venusia of this period exist. It took part in the Social War, and was recaptured by Quintus Metellus Pius; it then became a municipium, but in 43 BC its territory was assigned to the veterans of the triumvirs, and it became a colony once more. Horace was born here in 65 BC. It remained an important place under the Empire as a station on the Via Appia, though Theodor Mommsen's description of it as having branch roads to Aequum Tuticum and Potentia, and Kiepert's maps annexed to the volume, do not agree with one another.

Middle Ages

After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Venusia was sacked by the Heruls, and in 493 AD it was turned into the administrative centre of the area in the Ostrogothic kingdom of Italy, although later this role was moved to Acerenza.

The Lombards made it a gastaldate in 570/590.

In 842 Venosa was sacked by the Saracens, who were later ousted by Emperor Louis II.

Next rulers in the 9th century were the Byzantines, who lost control of it after their defeat in 1041 by the Normans. Under the latter, Venosa was assigned to Drogo of Hauteville. In 1133 the town was sacked and set on fire by Roger II of Sicily.

His later successor Frederick II had a castle built here where a Lombard outpost existed before, which was to house the Treasury (Ministry of Finances) of the Kingdom of Sicily.

Frederick's son, Manfred of Sicily, was perhaps born here in 1232. After the latter's fall, the Hohenstaufens were replaced by the Angevines; King Charles of Anjou assigned Venosa as a county to his son Robert.

Modern era
After a series of different feudal lords, Venosa became a possession of the Orsini in 1453. Count Pirro Del Balzo, who had married Donata Orsini, built a new castle (1460–1470) and a cathedral.

Then, under the Aragonese domination, followed the Gesualdo family (1561); amongst their number was the famous prince, musician and murderer Carlo Gesualdo.

Despite the plague that had reduced its population from the 13,000 of 1503 to 6,000, Venosa had a flourishing cultural life under the Gesualdos: apart from the famous Carlo, other relevant figures of the period include the poet Luigi Tansillo (1510–1580) and the jurist Giovanni Battista De Luca (1614–1683).

Venosa took part in the revolt of Masaniello in 1647. The Gesualdos were in turn followed by the Ludovisi and the Caracciolo families.

Home to a traditionally strong republican tradition, Venosa had a role in the peasant revolts and the Carbonari movement of the early 19th century.

A true civil war between baronial powers and supporters of the peasants' rights broke out in 1849, being harshly suppressed by the Neapolitan troops.(See Sicilian revolution of independence of 1848.)

In 1861, after the fall of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies during the Italian unification, Venosa was occupied by some bands of brigands under the command of Carmine Crocco in order to restore the Bourbon power in Basilicata.

Main sights

The Aragonese castle, built in 1470 by Pirro del Balzo Orsini. It has a square plan with four cylindrical towers. The shining sun, the del Balzo coat of arms, is visible on the western towers. It was turned into a residence by Carlo and Emanuele Gesualdo, who added also an internal loggia, the north-western wing and bastions used as prisons. From 1612 it was the seat of the Accademia dei Rinascenti. It is now home to the National Museum of Venosa, inaugurated in 1991, with ancient Roman and other findings up to the 9th century. The entrance is preceded by a fountain conceded by King Charles I of Anjou.
Many fragments of Roman workmanship are built into the walls of the cathedral, which is due to Pirro del Balzo also (c. 1470).
The abbey church of SS. Trinità is historically interesting; it was consecrated in 1059 by Pope Nicholas II and passed into the hands of the Knights of Saint John in the time of Boniface VIII (1295–1303). In the central aisle is the tomb of Alberada, the first wife of Robert Guiscard and mother of Bohemund. An inscription on the wall commemorates the great Norman brothers William Iron Arm, Drogo, Humfrey and Robert Guiscard. The bones of these brothers rest together in a simple stone sarcophagus opposite the tomb of Alberada. The church also contains some 14th-century frescoes. Behind it is a larger church, which was begun for the Benedictines about 1150, from the designs of a French architect, in imitation of the Cluniac church at Paray-le-Monial, but never carried beyond the spring of the vaulting. The ancient amphitheatre adjacent furnished the materials for its walls.
Baroque Church of the Purgatory (or San Filippo Neri)
The Archaeological Area of Notarchirico, in the communal territory. It covers the Palaeolithic period with eleven layers dating from 600,000 to 300,000 years ago. Remains of ancient wildlife, including extinct species of elephants, bisons and rhinoceroses, have been found, as well as a fragment of a femur of Homo erectus.
Jewish catacombs with inscriptions in Hebrew, Greek and Latin show the importance of the Jewish population here in the 4th and 5th centuries.
Remains of the ancient city walls and of an amphitheatre still exist, and a number of inscriptions have been found there.

"Hardware is listed on the call-for-papers as relevant topic for ICLR 2017, and so the paper is on-topic.

We worked hard to improve on the initial reviewer assignment for this paper in ensure that we would get hardware-knowledgeable reviewers on board for this paper, although we only partly succeeded (due to conflicts, tight review deadlines, and more).

We are also still missing questions and comments from one reviewer.

ICLR papers should succeed in communicating with the ICLR audience, i.e., introducing concepts for this audience, and using a language that is accessible for this community.  But it need not connect with all of the ICLR community, which is dominated by algorithmic concerns; many may not have much background or interest in hardware and that is fine.  This situation is not unique, e.g., hardware-related papers in computer graphics and computer vision conferences are in the same situation.  It is also true, I think, that the audience and reviewers of hardware-related conferences may not be well-placed to fully understand and comment on all relevant algorithmic considerations that a hardware implementation targets. 

There remains disagreement as to the utility of achieving improvements related to fully connected layers, which would be good to resolve. And there also remains disagreement on the improvements (conceptual and performance-related) with respect to the state of the art, as recently rebutted by the authors.

" By regulating his feeding, sleeping, playing, and bathroom schedule, you help him fit comfortably into your life. The routine will bring him comfort, and you’ll have fewer “accidents” down the road.;
, After that, they should get 2-3 meals a day until they reach adulthood. Feed your puppy the amount recommended on the label. Many labels give only the total amount a dog should eat during the day. You’ll need to divide those amounts into portions throughout the day.


To ensure the puppy grows well, feed him in meals instead of leaving food out at all times. If he doesn't finish his food within 15 minutes, pick up and remove the rest.
Very small breeds often get low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). They should be fed four smaller meals spaced out to make sure their sugar levels are healthy throughout the day.

, He'll need a few weeks to adjust to the schedule, so expect accidents at first. But as the puppy grows up, he'll be able to go for longer periods between bathroom sessions.


Puppies 6-8 weeks old need to use the bathroom every hour during the day until they're housebroken. At night, you should let them out every 2-4 hours.
Puppies 8-16 weeks old should be able to hold it for about two hours during the day and four hours at night.

, Even when they're as young as eight weeks old, some puppies will sleep for a full eight hours during the night. Most, though, will need to use the bathroom at least once during the night. Do this 2-4 hours after putting your dog to bed.


It’s best to let the dog out every two hours the first night or two, just in case.
Begin increasing the time between wake-ups from every two hours to every four hours over several days or weeks. This will depend on the breed and how much your puppy sleeps. — Use your discretion.
Daytime napping is important for puppies, but if you let him nap all day, he won't sleep at night!

, During play, he'll learn that he's not allowed to bite or scratch, while working off his meals and growing strong and healthy. It also wears him out so he won't have excess energy that keeps him awake during scheduled nap or sleep times. A regular play schedule will keep him on his sleep schedule.


Training sessions should be fun enough for the puppy to count as play-time!
Keep your puppy safe while he plays. Help him avoid things like falling, getting stuck, or eating/chewing on things he shouldn’t.

, Crate training is the first step in potty training. Choose a crate with enough room for your dog to turn around comfortably. However, it shouldn't have so much room that he could use the bathroom in one corner and sleep in another. If your puppy learns to associate his crate with using the bathroom, he'll resist going into the crate to lay or sleep.


In the first few weeks, expect accidents in the crate even if it's the right size for the puppy. Don't lose your patience, though! He's still learning.
If your puppy is a larger breed, consider buying a crate with adjustable barriers that can be removed as the dog grows.

, The den or family room is a good location for crate training. Leave the crate door open so the puppy can explore it at his own pace, and treat him whenever he goes into the crate.


After he's grown used to the crate, start closing the door and leaving him in it for longer periods of time. Crate him at night and anytime you aren’t home or able to watch him.
You can move the crate between rooms, bringing it into the bedroom with you at night, for example. But always make sure it's somewhere your dog feels safe.

, If he associates going to the bathroom with a very specific place, he'll be less likely to have accidents in other places. It'll also make clean-up easier in the future because you'll know where he likes to go.

, Minimize how much time he plays outside during the first 2-4 weeks of potty training. Playing with the dog outside in the middle of his potty training will confuse him about what he should do when he goes outside. When he's mastered potty-training, you can start spending more playtime outside with him.

, ""Bathroom"" or ""Go potty"" are examples. When you take him outside, use that same phrase and the same tone of voice every time he goes to the bathroom. If your puppy uses the bathroom after you give the command, praise him with a lot of excitement and a treat.


You might also choose a separate command specific to encouraging your dog to defecate. Young puppies need to defecate more often, so teaching a dog to associate a specific command with defecating can be useful.

, This isn't a punishment, but a training tool. If your puppy doesn’t use the bathroom within a few minutes of you giving the command, put him in his crate for 5-10 minutes. The dog may whine or cry when confined to the crate, but don’t let them out.–It will confuse the learning process.


After 5-10 minutes have passed, take him back outside to use the bathroom and give the command again.
Repeat the process until he makes an attempt to use the bathroom after you give the command.
When he finally uses the bathroom, repeat the command and reward him with lots of praise and a treat, then let him back into the house to play.

, Hang the bell by the door you use each time you take the dog out. It should hang low enough for your puppy to reach with his paw or nose. Use the bell only with a single door at first. You can move the bell or add more bells at other doors once the puppy understands how the bell system works.


Very small breed dogs and very young puppies may not be able to hold it long enough to reach the door that leads outside. In that case, hang the bell wherever the dog spends the most time — the living room, for example. You can move the bell to the outside door when the puppy can hold it a little longer.
It helps to keep the dog’s living area small during the stage until potty training is well established. You might use a puppy gate and attach a bell to it.

, Hold out treats near the bell, and ring it when the dog comes to retrieve the treats. You might smear a little cheese or some other treat on the bell, and, when the dog touches the bell, reward him with an additional treat. Repeat this process until the dog knows to associate the bell with reward.

, Always open the door immediately after any hint of the bell ringing, and give lots of praise. There are a few different ways to train your puppy to ring the bell:


Without ringing the bell yourself, tap your fingers on the wall or door next to it, and say ""Outside."" Your puppy should learn to jump up to your fingers, ringing the bell in the process.
Hold a treat just behind the bell, and say ""Outside."" The puppy’s nose will ring the bell when he goes for the treat.
Physically take your puppy’s paw, hit the bell with it, and say ""Outside.""
Skip the bell training if you’re rushing out for a bathroom emergency. Only use the bell with scheduled bathroom breaks.

, Your puppy is very smart, and has a great sense of cause and effect. Anything he observes before the door opening/praise/treat will be seen as a cause of the desired effect. If you let variation creep into what your dog experiences before the door opens, he can become confused. Make it easy for him to learn what he needs to do to be let out. Keep it simple. For example, only use one of the methods outlined in the previous step — don't mix and match.

, You can either move the bell to different doors or hang a different bell by each exterior door. When you travel, take a bell with you so the dog can use it while on the road. Similarly, send the bell with your dog if he stays at another home while you’re away on a trip. If you need to find a new home for your dog, let the new owners know he's bell trained, and encourage them to make a bell available at the new home.

"We study the Green function of a relativistic $\alpha$-ssble process in a half-space with reflecting boundary condition at the boundary, and obtain two-sided estimates on its tail behavior by using the method of reflection principle. The results are applied to the case when the underlying space is $\mathbb{R}^d$ or $\mathbb{H}^1(\mathbb{R})$. We also give an example showing that our upper bound can be strictly smaller than the lower one. Finally we prove some properties of the Green functions of relativistic $\alpha$-stables processes killed upon leaving a domain. Let $(X_t)_{t \geq 0}$ be a relativistic $\alpha$-self-decomposable Lévy process (see Definition 2 below), which has been introduced independently by Bertoin [1] , Sato [2] and Watanabe [3] . It is known that this process possesses many interesting properties such as self-similarity, infinite divisibility etc. (see e.g., [4] ). In particular, it follows from [5] that there exists a constant $c > 0$ depending only on $\alpha$ such that 
$$P[X_1 = 0] \leq c \exp \left( - \frac{1}{2} |x|^{2 + \alpha} \right). $$"	1
"The chapel is located in the village of Hampstead, London and was built between 1625–1630 by Sir Henry Wotton as part of his country estate at Holborn Hill (now known as Hampstead Garden Suburb). It has been designated Grade I listed status since 1950.
It contains some notable features including Jacobean pulpit, altarpiece depicting Saint Michael defeating Satan from about 1600, stained glass window designed by Edward Burne-Jones showing The Angel Gabriel Announcing to Mary that She Would Be the Mother of Jesus dated c. 1900–1901, and memorials to several members of the family of poet Lord Alfred Tennyson who lived nearby on Mornington Crescent."	1
" Buy a brand new journal and use it only for career-related entries. Have it with you when you conduct career research. Makes notes not only about the information you locate during your research, but you personal thoughts and feelings about what you’ve found. Write down questions that arise while doing your research and work to get answers for them. Practice job interview questions and answers. Makes notes about things that went well and didn’t go well in interviews. Your career journal can be as structured or carefree as you want. There are no set rules as to what it should or should not contain. Allow it to reflect your personality so you’ll feel comfortable writing in it on a regular basis.;
, There are many places you can go to research different types of jobs and careers, including your guidance counsellor, a university career center, a career coaches and websites, government websites, journals and magazines, newspapers, blogs, books, and more. Start by selecting one or two of these options and investigate the details regarding a career in medicine, specifically oncology.


Learn about the details of what the job does, what type of work environment they have, educational requirements, potential pay ranges, and even what the future job market may look like.Read the advice and opinions of people who are already medical doctors and oncologists, possibly via personal blogs or a day in the life of articles.Record your findings, ideas and questions in your career journal.

, All major hospitals and medical clinics will have formal volunteer programs. Contact the volunteer coordinator and determine the application process. Apply for a volunteer position. Focus on departments or organizations related to oncology.


Consider volunteering for a local cancer charity event, like a marathon, golf tournament, or daffodil days.Use the opportunity to speak with cancer patients and their families.
Consider volunteering at a camp for children with cancer.Use the opportunity not only to make the kid’s happy, but to see how the disease affects children and the potential you have to help them in the future.
While volunteering think about what it would be like to be in a similar environment on a regular basis. What sorts of things bother you? Can you overcome them? Do you find it emotionally difficult to deal with the patients? Use this as a learning experience to help assess if oncology is still the right career goal for you.

, You will definitely have the opportunity to do something like this while in medical school, but you may want to complete a job shadow at least once before medical school to gain a better understanding of what an oncologist does on a daily basis. Some hospitals may have formal job shadowing programs, but you can also reach out personally to a department or doctor to request a job shadow.The volunteer program at a hospital, or the career center at a medical school, may be able to recommend a specific oncologist to contact directly. Or they may be able to provide you with a formal process to follow to sign up.
Bring your career journal with you to take notes. As a job shadower, you’re there to observe, not necessarily participate. Watch what goes on and write down your questions, ideas and observations.
Once the doctor is finished with his/her patients, go over your questions with them. There are no bad questions.
Dress appropriately. If you’re in a hospital setting you’ll probably be on your feet for a long time, so make sure you’re comfortable. But also dress professionally as you want to project a respectful image to both the doctor and the patients.
Write about your experiences in your career journal.
Send the doctor you shadowed, and anyone else who helped make it happen, a thank you card afterwards. Maybe throw in a coffee gift card too - no doubt every doctor would appreciate coffee!
Be very respectful of the patients. Information you learn that is of a personal nature will be confidential and you should not talk about it with anyone other than the doctor your shadowing. Do not assume every patient is going to want you around, allow the doctor to introduce you and if the patient is uncomfortable, wait outside the room.

, A mentor is someone who is an experienced oncologist who has agreed to advise and counsel you about oncology and an oncology career.You may not be able to obtain a mentor such as this until your internship or residency as a mentee really should be pursuing the career already.


Formal mentoring programs do exist. If your medical school or hospital has one, definitely take advantage of it. If they don’t, actively seek out a mentor informally by becoming involved with the work of an oncologist you admire.Use your career journal to make notes of your observations, ideas and questions.

, Remember to look at your career journal on a regular basis. Determine if you have any outstanding questions you'd like answered - and get them answered. Write down any new thoughts and ideas that have come to mind since the last time you wrote in your journal. Keep track of any experiences you've had that are career-related, even if they aren't specifically related to medicine. Reevaluate your career goals and/or plans if you feel they've changed., Most universities do not have formal pre-med programs. And in fact, medical schools, in general, do not require a specific undergraduate degree in order to apply. As harsh as it sounds, medical schools are more interested in your overall GPA and your MCAT score. Therefore, your goal in choosing an undergraduate program should be that it helps you achieve the highest GPA and MCAT scores possible.Review pre-med program rankings. There are many organizations that rank colleges and universities in different ways, including what schools have the best pre-med program. While you certainly don’t need to apply to the best, if you can, you should.When selecting a program consider the following: Does the program prepare me properly for the MCAT? Does the program maximize my chances of getting the best GPA possible? Does the program help me obtain another career if I don’t end up in medical school? Does the program help me in medical school?Your undergraduate program doesn’t have to be in biology, or even science. If you can get better grades by completing an undergraduate humanities degree, go for it.
Use the Association of American Medical College’s (AAMC) Pre-Med Coursework Worksheet to select a program that will allow you to complete all the course requirements.

, If you’ve selected your program based on school rankings, skip this step. Once you’ve figured out what type of degree program you want to pursue, you now have to find a place to pursue it. Determine if you have any specific restrictions that limit your choices - i.e. financial, geographical, etc. Eliminate any schools do not offer the program you want, or include the restrictions you’ve identified.Make a list of all the possible undergraduate schools that meet your criteria. Write down what your priorities for an undergraduate school are - for example, low cost, far away from home, also has a medical school, great pubs, etc. - and then rank them. Score each school against your priorities, then rank the schools. Select your top 20 or so schools to investigate further.
Obtain undergraduate admissions packages from each of your selected schools and review them.
Sign-up and attend local school information sessions, if they’re offered.
Sign-up and attend on-campus school tours and discipline-specific information sessions.If possible, speak to a current or former student and ask their opinion about the school.
If possible, speak to a couple of current professors in your programs of interest and ask why you should attend that particular school.
Speak to your high school guidance or university counsellor for advice.
Review university/college rankings.
Assess each school (using your career journal) and make a final ranking.
Select how many schools you’re going to submit an application for. There is no real limit to how many applications you submit, except money and time. Each application comes with a fee, which is anywhere between $40 and $100. While there is no general consensus on the ideal number, the most common number is between 6 and 14.If in doubt, go with your gut!

, Over 500 colleges accept something called The Common Application, which, when used, can significantly reduce the amount of time required to apply to an undergraduate program. If you are applying to one or more of the Common Application member schools, you can complete the application process on their website and will only need to complete the standard portions of the application once. For any schools who are not Common Application members, you will need to go to their admissions website to complete the application. For the purpose of an example, we’ll use Rutgers University, which does not accept the Common Application.


Go to the university’s undergraduate admissions website and find the location of the online application portal. Go to the online portal and register for an account.
Check the admissions website for application deadlines for the term you’d like to start - most commonly it would be the fall term, starting in September. The timeline will also include the date by which a decision is made and communicated to you, and the date by which you have to tell the university if you’re going to attend.
Take note of the required application fee, and how it is to be paid. Most universities will require the fee to be paid before they’ll even look at your application.
Look for an application checklist which will list all the items you’ll need to submit or do for the application. The checklist will normally include additional items like your self-reported academic record or high school transcripts and SAT/ACT scores. Make sure you have these items ready, or have already electronically submitted them to the university.
Review the requirements for an admissions essay, including how it needs to be submitted. Write a first draft of your essay and then have someone (like a parent or guidance counsellor) review it. Revise, edit and complete your essay.
Review whether your application will require a list of extracurricular activities, which would include employment, community service/volunteering, athletics, etc.
Review whether your application will require letters of recommendation. If required, determine how many you need, and who they have to be from (i.e. teachers, parents, employers, etc.). Select whom you’d like to have write you a letter and ask them. Remember to send them a thank you once they’ve submitted the letter! Note that in some cases letters of references must be submitted directly to the university from the referee.
Log into the admissions application portal and complete the application, then submit it.

, Keep track of the decision dates that were outlined on the university’s admissions website. There may be multiple dates if the university allows for early admissions application. Most universities will provide a decision in the online admissions portal where you submitted your application, or via a specific email address that you registered for. Check the online portal (at least) after the decision deadlines to determine which schools you’ve been accepted to.


In general you’ll get one of three types of responses - accepted, rejected or waitlisted.
You are not required to confirm your acceptance before May 1st (for fall admission), so don’t make any final decisions until you’ve received responses from all your applications.Once you’ve received all responses, accept the offer from the highest ranked school you determined in previous steps - unless you’ve changed your mind.
Acceptances are usually followed by an enrolment or registration deposit to hold your spot at the school. You should only submit an acceptance and enrolment deposit to one school.After you’ve been accepted you’ll normally receive invitations to come (back) to the school for tours and events. Attending them isn’t required, but you’ll certainly view the school differently now that you know you’ll be attending!

, The most important part to remember throughout school is to ensure you’ve completed all the required prerequisite courses for your medical school application.Keep track of your GPA. Consider dropping a course before the appropriate deadline (the deadline by which you can drop a course and it will not appear on your transcript) if you think you’ll end up with a bad grade.

, All medical school applications will want to know about your non-academic activities, including awards, employment, volunteer work, sports, school groups, etc.Follow the AAMC’s Timeline for Application/Admission to Medical School PDF to make sure you complete as many extracurricular activities as you can that will be helpful for medical school admission.


Apply for medical or science-related internships during the summer months.
Apply for research assistantship positions (paid or unpaid) during the summer and school terms.

, All medical schools will require at least 2-3 letters of recommendation from someone who knows your abilities and skills. Letters from university professors, doctors, deans and associate deans, etc., are normally required.Volunteering in a professor’s lab, or working in a medical research centre, will make sure the professor knows you well enough to write a letter.

, The MCAT, or Medical College Admissions Test, is a standard test required by all medical schools. It is administered via the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC). The AAMC recommends taking the MCAT once you have completed any coursework that is relevant to the subjects on the test.However, each medical school will have its own requirements as to how old the score can be when you apply - the norm is 2-3 years old maximum.


The AAMC provides a timeline that can help you plan when to register for the MCAT, when to take it and when to apply to medical school.
The AAMC implemented a new MCAT in 2015, which replaces their previous version from 1991. If you took the MCAT before 2015, it is very important that you check the Medical school policies for accepting scores from the current and the new MCAT exams PDF. Some medical schools will only accept the 2015 version of the MCAT as of certain admissions cycles.
While not required, it is strongly recommended that you take some sort of prep course for writing the MCAT. The way the test is laid out, and the way in which it is timed, are very important and knowing this in advance is extremely helpful. Most prep courses also hold one or more fake exams to give you an idea of what it’ll be like in the real thing.
You can take the MCAT more than once, if you feel you didn’t do well the first time.However, be aware that some medical schools will actually combine the averages of the scores if the test was taken more than once (and you cannot prevent this)., There are over 170 accredited medical schools in the United States.Several medical school rankings exist that help determine which schools are better than others, based on a variety of factors.There are also a number of tools found online that can help you evaluate which medical school(s) are right for you.In the end, however, selecting a medical school will be similar to when you selected an undergraduate school. You may have restrictions, such as financial, geographical, etc., that may limit which schools you can apply to.


Make a list of all the possible medical schools - in your career journal - that meet your criteria. Write down what your priorities for a medical school are - for example, cost, reputation, class sizes, research programs, faculty, etc. - and then rank them. Score each school against your priorities, then rank the schools.
Read all the information about each medical school on their websites.
Attend any seminars, webinars or information sessions held by the medical school. Ask questions.
Book a campus tour at each medical school, if possible.
Seek the advice of your professors, school career advisors and alumni.
Review the medical school rankings.
Assess each school (using your career journal) and make a final ranking.
Determine how many applications you’re going to submit. In 2014, over 170 medical schools in the U.S. received 731,595 applications, yet they only graduated 20,343 students in the same year.That’s less than a 3% admissions rate! As with undergraduate programs, there is no limit to the number of medical schools you can apply, but the fees associated with these applications are much higher ($160 for the first one plus $36 for each additional one).If you can afford it, you should try to apply to all the medical schools that interest you.
If in doubt, go with your gut!

, Contact the people who you’d like to write your letters of recommendation and request the letters. Since you might ask one referee to send a letter to more than one school, it will probably be helpful to create a list of the medical schools and the mailing addresses for the letters and send this list to each referee. They’ll probably use the same basic letter for each school, but preparing them will take time.Letters of recommendation have to mailed directly from the referee to the medical school, so don’t have your referees send the letters back to you.

, All medical school applications can be submitted via the American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS) and/or the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine Application Service (AACOMAS). These services allow you to submit one full application and send it to as many medical schools as you want.The first application will cost $160 and each additional medical school will cost $36.,,
Log into the website, when ready, and enter all the information requested while following the instruction manual.Submit the application online, when completed, and pay all the associated application fees.Check your AMCAS and/or AACOMAS account(s) regularly to check the status of each application and submit any additional information that is requested., Some, but not all, medical schools will require an interview as part of the admissions process. Some interviews may be conducted on the phone or via the internet, but many are done in person.Book your travel to/from each medical school.
For each medical school for which an interview is requested, print out and complete the Mission & Interview Question Worksheet from the AAMC website.
For each medical school for which an interview is requested, review their website and read any information they have posted regarding the interview.
Review your career journal and determine if you have any outstanding questions you wanted to ask during the interview.

, Review the admissions websites for each medical to which you have applied and check the timeline for when you can expect an admission offer and the deadline for when you have to accept the offer.If you’ve been accepted to more than one medical school, check how you ranked the schools and accept the school that you ranked highest - unless you’ve changed your mind.

, In general medical school will take 4 years to complete, and those 4 years are very structured.Your first year, and possibly some or all of your second year, will include mainly coursework. Your second and/or third years will include actual clinical experience where you’ll rotate among most of the major medical disciplines. Your third and/or your last year will be spent on a project that will include additional clinical experience, but this time in a specific discipline of your interest.


Your scholarly project is where you can focus on oncology as a specialty, and be assigned to one or more oncologists as an advisor or mentor., There are three main types of oncologists - medical, radiation and surgical. In addition, there are also oncologists who specialize in gynecology, pediatrics and hematology.Based on your experiences in medical school, select which type of oncology you’d like to focus on - this will help narrow down residency options.

, By this point in your medical education, you’ll have met a lot of medical doctors, specialists, and professors, not to mention fellow students. All of these are sources for ideas on where to do a residency. Do some additional research online and determine what your priorities are for a residency - then compare those priorities to the programs offered. Select more than one program to which to apply.


There are many things to consider regarding a residency, including: the stability of the program (does it have a future?), what type of support you get in the program, how flexible is the program schedule, what is the reputation of the institution, does it provide you with the possibility of advancement after it done, location, and more., Review all the prerequisites and requirements of the application and ensure you have them all in order. Write a draft of your personal statement, walk away for at least 24 hours and come back and revise it. Ask someone (professor, doctor, fellow student) to review your statement for you and provide feedback. Update and finalize your CV. Submit your applications via the method indicated for each program.Many residency programs use the National Resident Matching Program (NRMP) which helps potential residents and residency programs find each other.Many residency programs also use the Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS) as a centralized method to receive applications and documentation from applicants., Just like medical school, every residency program will want to interview you before offering your admission to their program. At this level it is likely you’ll need to attend the interview in person, but some programs may help pay the cost of travel., Your residency offers (or matches in this case) will come through the ERAS system where you submitted your application. All residency matches are released on Match Day which is the third Friday of March each year.Due to how the system works, you should receive only one offer - based on how your ranked each programs, and how each program ranked you. You are required to accept that offer, which means you have to be very care how many programs you select, and how you rank them., The experiences you gain in your residency program are vital to your career as an oncologist. Don't hesitate to ask questions if you have any. Use your residency to enlarge your professional network and learn about potential fellowships and full-time jobs.

, The USMLE is a three-step examination that tests potential doctor’s on their skills in medicine and patient care. Medical licenses are granted by each state, not nationally, but each state requires the USMLE as a requirement to licensing.Use the Licensing Examination Services portal of the National Board of Medical Examiners to register for Steps 1 or 2 of the examination.
Step 1 and Step 2 CK exams cost $590 each, Step 2 CK costs $1250, Step 3 costs $815..Step 1 is normally taken after your second year of medical school, while Step 2 is normally taken after your fourth year of medical school. Step 3 is taken while you’re completing your residency.The process to apply for Step 3 of the examination differs between states, but you can use the Federation of State Medical Boards online portal to register and pay for the Step 3 exam.

, Each state has its own medical board which controls licensing of doctors, therefore each state has slightly different requirements for obtaining a license. Find the medical board’s website for the state where you will be practicing and review the licensing procedure.We will use the state of Colorado as our example for obtaining your medical license.
The state of Colorado requires that you have malpractice insurance in the state ‘’’before’’’ you apply for your license.Obtain malpractice insurance if you do not already have it, or determine if you meet one of the exception requirements.
The state of Colorado requires that each applicant meet the following qualifications: proof of graduation from medical school, passage of USMLE or other national exam, completion of postgraduate education (i.e. residency) and reference letters from places where you have previously practiced.Twenty-three states use the Federation of State Medical Boards’ Uniform Application for potential licensees.The Uniform Application is essentially a centralized, online application portal for submitting license requirements. The nice thing about the Uniform Application is that once you’ve completed one application it can be sent to any of the states that participate in the program., Medical oncologists must complete a three-year residency in internal medicine and then complete a two-year fellowship in medical oncology. Surgical oncologists must complete a five-year residency in general surgery and then complete a two-year fellowship in surgical oncology. Radiation oncologists complete a five-year radiation oncology program (residency) but do not need to complete a fellowship., Board certification is not a requirement to practice medicine or oncology. However, board certification will most likely increase your reputation and job potential.


Medical oncology is certified by the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM).
Radiation oncology is certified by either the The American Board of Radiology or The American Board of Physician Specialties.
Surgical oncology is certified by the The American Board of Medical Specialties.

, During your residency and/or fellowship you would have developed an extensive professional network. Use your network to determine if there are any oncologist positions available in your favoured locations. Search for oncology positions on your own using any and all resources available to you.


The Journal of Clinical Oncology, as an example, has an online Oncology Career Centre with oncology-related positions available in the United States, and around the world. Each posting will provide you with instructions on how to apply to that specific position.
The Society of Surgical Oncology, as another example, has a career website that specialized in surgical oncologist positions available in the United States. Each posting will provide instructions on how to apply to that specific position.
Remember that if you apply to and accept a position in a state other than where you're licensed, you will need to obtain a license to practice medicine in that state before you can begin practicing.
Take advantage of the career centers and advisors available at your medical school to help you find oncology positions. Use their help to update your CV, craft cover letters and personal statements, and practice for interviews."	0

"We present an exact expression for the probability distribution function (PDF) of the number of steps taken by a one-dimensional, discrete-time, self-propelled particle that moves in a periodic potential and interacts with itself via elastic collisions.  We show how this PDF can be used to calculate the mean-square displacement as well as other statistical properties of such particles. The results are illustrated using numerical simulations. 
PACS numbers: 05.45.-a; 05.70.Jk; 05.60.Gg 
I. INTRODUCTORY REMARkS
The motion of many biological systems is often described as being driven by internal forces or active processes [1] . Examples include bacteria swimming through fluids [2] , cells crawling on surfaces [3] , and molecular motors moving along cytoskeletal filaments [4] .
In recent years there has been growing interest in understanding the dynamics of these active particles [5] - [8] . In particular, it was shown that their behavior may differ significantly from that observed in passive Brownian particles [9] - [11] . For example, while the latter exhibit normal diffusion at large timescales [12] , active particles typically display superdiffusive [13] or even ballistic [14] transport depending on the details of their interactions [15] - [17] . This difference arises because active particles have additional degrees of freedom which allow them to explore more efficiently the available space [18] . As a result they tend to move faster than passive particles [19] .
Recently we introduced a model describing the motion of a single active particle [20] . It consists of a point-like object that performs a biased random walk in a periodic potential [21] . Its position x(t + 1) = x(t) + v t+1 − v t is determined by its velocity v t+1 = f [x(t), v t ] where f [·] denotes some deterministic force acting upon the particle [22] . Here we consider two different types of potentials V (x). First, when V (x) ∝ cos(2πx/L) (L is the periodicity length), the system exhibits a series of metastable states separated by energy barriers [23] . Second"	1
"The authors present an interesting approach to speed up convolutional neural networks (CNN) by using direct sparse convolution, which is similar in spirit but different from group sparsity used previously.  The main idea of this method is that it allows one to use fewer parameters than traditional methods while still maintaining accuracy.
In addition they introduce guided pruning as another way to reduce model size without sacrificing performance. 
I think their results are very promising especially since there has been little work done on reducing computational complexity of deep learning models so far. 

However I have some questions about how exactly these two techniques interact together.  

First off what does ""guided"" mean? Doesn't say here... 
Second why do you need both approaches at all?  Why not just go straight into direct sparse convolution?

Thirdly if we want to keep our network small shouldn't we be able to get rid of most layers anyway? 

Finally what's going on when training your network? How many epochs did you train each time before doing any pruning or fine-tuning?"	1
"  We study two continuous variable systems (or two harmonic oscillators) and
investigate their entanglement evolution under the influence of non-Markovian
thermal environments. The continuous variable systems could be two modes of
electromagnetic fields or two nanomechanical oscillators in the quantum domain.
We use quantum open system method to derive the non-Markovian master equations
of the reduced density matrix for two different but related models of the
continuous variable systems. The two models both consist of two interacting
harmonic oscillators. In model A, each of the two oscillators is coupled to its
own independent thermal reservoir, while in model B the two oscillators are
coupled to a common reservoir. To quantify the degrees of entanglement for the
bipartite continuous variable systems in Gaussian states, logarithmic
negativity is used. We find that the dynamics of the quantum entanglement is
sensitive to the initial states, the oscillator-oscillator interaction, the
oscillator-environment interaction and the coupling to a common bath or to
different, independent baths.

"  Context: Ly-alpha-emitters have proven to be excellent probes of faint,
star-forming galaxies in the high redshift universe. However, although the
sample of known emitters is increasingly growing, their nature (e.g. stellar
masses, ages, metallicities, star-formation rates) is still poorly constrained.
  Aims: We aim to study the nature of Ly-alpha-emitters, to find the properties
of a typical Ly-alpha-emitting galaxy and to compare these properties with the
properties of other galaxies at similar redshift, in particular Lyman-break
galaxies.
  Methods: We have performed narrow-band imaging at the VLT, focused on
Ly-alpha at redshift z ~ 3.15, in the GOODS-S field. We have identified a
sample of Ly-alpha-emitting candidates, and we have studied their Spectral
Energy Distributions (SEDs).
  Results: We find that the emitters are best fit by an SED with low
metallicity (Z/Z_sun = 0.005), low dust extinction (A_V ~ 0.32) and medium
stellar masses of approximately 10^9 M_sun. The age is not very well
constrained. One object out of 24 appears to be a high redshift
Ly-alpha-emitting dusty starburst galaxy. We find filamentary structure as
traced by the Ly-alpha-emitters at the 4 sigma level. The rest-frame UV SED of
these galaxies is very similar to that of Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) and
comply with the selection criteria for U-band drop-outs, except they are
intrinsically fainter than the current limit for LBGs.
  Conclusion: Ly-alpha-emitters are excellent probes of galaxies in the distant
universe, and represent a class of star-forming, dust and AGN free, medium mass
objects.

"  The addition of metals to any gas can significantly alter its evolution by
increasing the rate of radiative cooling. In star-forming environments,
enhanced cooling can potentially lead to fragmentation and the formation of
low-mass stars, where metal-free gas-clouds have been shown not to fragment.
Adding metal cooling to numerical simulations has traditionally required a
choice between speed and accuracy. We introduce a method that uses the
sophisticated chemical network of the photoionization software, Cloudy, to
include radiative cooling from a complete set of metals up to atomic number 30
(Zn) that can be used with large-scale three-dimensional hydrodynamic
simulations. Our method is valid over an extremely large temperature range (10
K < T < 10^8 K), up to hydrogen number densities of 10^12 cm^-3. At this
density, a sphere of 1 Msun has a radius of roughly 40 AU. We implement our
method in the adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) hydrodynamic/N-body code, Enzo.
Using cooling rates generated with this method, we study the physical
conditions that led to the transition from Population III to Population II star
formation. While C, O, Fe, and Si have been previously shown to make the
strongest contribution to the cooling in low-metallicity gas, we find that up
to 40% of the metal cooling comes from fine-structure emission by S, when solar
abundance patterns are present. At metallicities, Z > 10^-4 Zsun, regions of
density and temperature exist where gas is both thermally unstable and has a
cooling time less than its dynamical time. We identify these doubly unstable
regions as the most inducive to fragmentation. At high redshifts, the CMB
inhibits efficient cooling at low temperatures and, thus, reduces the size of
the doubly unstable regions, making fragmentation more difficult.

"  A 21 cm neutral hydrogen interferometric survey of the Large Magellanic Cloud
(LMC) combined with the Parkes multi-beam HI single-dish survey clearly shows
that the HI gas is distributed in the form of clumps or clouds. The HI clouds
and clumps have been identified using a thresholding method with three separate
brightness temperature thresholds ($T_b$). Each catalog of HI cloud candidates
shows a power law relationship between the sizes and the velocity dispersions
of the clouds roughly following the Larson Law scaling $\sigma_v \propto
R^{0.5}$, with steeper indices associated with dynamically hot regions. The
clouds in each catalog have roughly constant virial parameters as a function
mass suggesting that that the clouds are all in roughly the same dynamical
state, but the values of the virial parameter are significantly larger than
unity showing that turbulent motions dominate gravity in these clouds. The mass
distribution of the clouds is a power law with differential indices between
-1.6 and -2.0 for the three catalogs. In contrast, the distribution of mean
surface densities is a log-normal distribution.

"First up, I want to point out that this paper is really long. Like 17 pages long -- without any supplementary material. While ICLR does not have an official page limit, it would be nice if authors put themselves in the reviewer's shoes and did not take undue advantage of this rule. Having 1 or 2 pages in addition to the conventional 8 page limit is ok, but more than doubling the pages is quite unfair. 

Now for the review: The paper proposes a new artificial dataset for sequence learning. I call it artificial because it was artificially generated from the original MNIST dataset which is a smallish dataset of real images of handwritten digits. In addition to the dataset, the authors propose to train recurrent networks using a schedule over the length of the sequence, which they call ""incremental learning"". The experiments show that their proposed schedule is better than not having any schedule on this data set. Furthermore, they also show that their proposed schedule is better than a few other intuitive schedules. The authors verify this by doing some ablation studies over the model on the proposed dataset. 

I have following issues with this paper: 

-- I did not find anything novel in this paper. The proposed incremental learning schedule is nothing new and is a natural thing to try when learning sequences. Similar idea have already been tried by a number of authors, including Bengio 2015, and Ranzato 2015. The only new piece of work is the ablation studies which the authors conduct to tease out and verify that indeed the improvement in performance is due to the curriculum used. 

-- Furthermore, the authors only test their hypothesis on a single dataset which they propose and is artificially generated. Why not use it on a real sequential dataset, such as, language modeling. Does the technique not work in that scenario? In fact I am quite positive that for language modeling where the vocabulary size is huge, the performance gains will be no where close to the 74% reported in the paper.

-- I'm not convinced about the value of having this artificial dataset. Already there are so many real world sequential dataset available, including in text, speech, finance and other areas. What exactly does this dataset bring to the table is not super clear to me. While having another dataset may not be a bad thing in itself, I almost felt that this dataset was created for the sole purpose of making the proposed ideas work. It would have been so much better had the authors shown experiments on other datasets. 

-- As I said, the paper is way too long. A significant part of the length of the paper is due to a collection of experiments which are completely un-related to the main message of the paper. For instance, the experiment in Section 6.2 is completely unrelated to the story of the paper. Same is true with the transfer learning experiments of Section 6.4.

"This work presents a novel way how to learn invariant features from unlabeled target samples using deep neural network architectures. It proposes a new loss term which matches higher-order central moments between domains. This leads to improved results compared to previous methods such as maximum mean discrepancies or variational fair autoencoder losses.
In particular it improves over adversarially learned inference models when applied to real-world problems like cross-domain image classification.  I think this article will interest researchers working on transfer learning techniques based on deep neural nets. Overall good quality research! 
I have only minor comments/questions regarding the presentation. 

1.) What are the advantages of the proposed approach? Improved results compared to previous methods... Yes,  but what about computational complexity?  Is there any additional overhead introduced due to the use of the new loss terms?

2.) How do you compare your results against other works? No"	1

Because people are too lazy and selfish not to do that, they don't care about others' lives or safety. They just want their own convenience at all costs. It's also because of how much money there would be in fines if you were caught doing this (which isn't very likely). People will always find ways around things like laws when it's convenient for them. Because most drivers aren't willing to slow down even though they're driving slower than everyone else on purpose. This makes other drivers angry but no one wants to admit it since they'll get blamed by someone who doesn't know what happened anyway. Most drivers have never been taught proper defensive driving skills either which means they can't handle being behind another car that's going faster then themselves without getting frustrated with them. There should be more traffic enforcement officers out patrolling instead of sitting inside an office somewhere making sure everything's running smoothly while nothing happens outside. The police force needs to start enforcing these rules again	1
"Christy Moylan (4 December 1914 - 6 August 1996) was an Irish sportsperson.  He played hurling with his local club Dungarvan and with the Waterford senior inter-county team from 1935 until 1949.

Playing career

Club

Moylan played his club hurling with his local club in Dungarvan, and won a senior county title with the club in 1941.  This was Dungarvan's last victory in the county championship.

Inter-county

Moylan first joined the Waterford inter-county squad in the 1930s.  He made his senior debut with the team in 1935.

In 1938, Moylan lined out in his first Munster final. The game saw Clare providing the opposition.  In a close game, Waterford emerged as the victors on a score line of 3-5 to 2-5.  Not only was it Moylan’s first Munster Senior Hurling Championship medal, but it was also the first time that Waterford had won the provincial title.  Waterford later beat Galway, allowing Moylan’s side to advance to their first-ever All-Ireland final.  Dublin provided the opposition in the final, and Declan Goode scored a goal for Waterford after just six minutes. However, Dublin fought back with goals of their own, and Dublin won on a score line of 2-5 to 1-6.

Waterford went into decline following this defeat. A two-point loss to Cork in the Munster final of 1943 was the only high point for Moylan.

In 1948, then years after their first provincial title, Waterford were back in the Munster final, this time against Cork.  Waterford emerged victorious on a score line of 4-7 to 3-9 giving Moylan his second Munster medal.  Galway fell again in the penultimate game of the championship, allowing Waterford to advance to the All-Ireland final.  Just like ten years previously, Dublin provided the opposition.  Once again Waterford got off to a good start and led by nine points at half-time.  Four goals followed in the second-half courtesy of John Keane, Willie Galvin, Eddie Daly and Moylan.  Waterford won on a score line of 6-7 to 4-2 giving Moylan his first All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship medal.

Moylan continued playing in 1949, however, Waterford surrendered their provincial and All-Ireland crowns at the first hurdle.  Moylan retired from inter-county hurling following this defeat.

Provincial

Moylan also lined out with Munster in the inter-provincial hurling competition.  He first lined out for his province in 1937 and captured his first Railway Cup medal in 1937.  It was the first of four inter-provincial titles in-a-row.  Moylan won his fifth and final Railway Cup medal in 1942.

Post-playing career

In retirement from playing Moylan maintained an interest in the game.  Long after his playing days were over, his skill as a player was recognised when he was the recipient of the GAA All-Time All-Star award.  Past winners of the award included Mick Mackey, Jack Lynch and Jim Langton.

" Thrush, or oral candidiasis, is caused by an overgrowth of a type of fungus, or yeast, called candida albicans. Candida is a normal part of the body.Candida albicans is naturally found throughout the gastrointestinal tract, including the mouth. Candida is also a normal resident of the skin.A thrush infection happens when the candida albicans yeast cells find a source of nutrients they like, and grow beyond what is considered normal.;
, White, patchy areas on the tongue, and other parts of the mouth are the most common symptom.Additional symptoms include inflamed, or reddened, areas in the mouth, accompanied by soreness. This can cause a sore throat, difficulty swallowing, and a loss of taste.Some areas might bleed slightly if they are scraped.Cracking, itching and pain at the corners of the mouth is common with oral thrush., Understand the risks of untreated thrush infections. Candidiasis infection, like thrush, left untreated can result in serious health problems.Candida is normally present on the skin, and throughout the gut, and causes no health problems.However, when an overgrowth occurs, it is important to treat the condition before it spreads further, and gains access to the systemic circulation. A systemic candidiasis infections is called invasive candidiasis.Realize the seriousness of an invasive candidiasis infection. Invasive candidiasis is an infection that occurs when the candida infection spreads into the systemic circulation, called candidemia.This type of infection is a serious condition, and can affect the blood, heart, brain, eyes, bones, as well as other parts of the body.People with weaker immune systems are the ones primarily at risk of developing invasive candidiasis. This type of infection requires hospitalization, involves added expense, and, in some cases, results in less than desirable outcomes.Invasive candidiasis is a major type of infection acquired by patients being treated in a hospital or facility setting for other reasons.See a doctor early. Seeking medical attention early and taking a prescription medication are the best ways to effectively manage the initial symptoms of a candida infection.This is the most effective approach to prevent invasive candidiasis and candidemia., It is somewhat rare to see oral thrush in healthy children, adolescents, and adults. But anyone can develop thrush, and the infection is easily treated.Since this condition is considered unusual in healthy people, there may be an underlying cause for the thrush to have developed.In addition, some conditions may look like candida, such as oral cancers or precancerous conditions, so make sure to see you doctor if you are haven't had thrush before or if it does not go away with treatment.
It is recommended that cases of thrush be evaluated by a doctor to provide both effective treatment, and to be sure there is no change in the person’s overall immune system., According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, thrush, or candida, infections that develop in the mouth or throat require the use of prescription medications for effective treatment.The exact medications and the length of treatment will vary depending on the person’s age, general health status, currently prescribed medications, and immune system strength.Make sure that you complete the full prescribed course of medication, or else the thrush may return.

, Treating oral candidiasis is often done by using a product that can be applied topically. This is especially true for infants and young children.Liquid products, such as nystatin oral suspension, are applied topically by either swabbing, or “painting”, the suspension onto the surfaces infected. Nystatin is effective at treating the infection, and is safe if swallowed.In addition to using liquid forms, antifungal creams, ointments, and oral doses such as troches, deliver the medication in a topical manner.Use dissolvable prescription products. Some products are made in dissolvable forms, called troches, that are placed in the mouth to dissolve.This method of administration allows the medication to come into direct contact with the infected areas., In some cases, the medication may be prescribed in a tablet, capsule, or liquid form, that is intended to be swallowed.The antifungal medication works through systemic absorption, just like taking an antibiotic.Some examples of medications prescribed to treat thrush include fluconazole, nystatin, itraconazole, clotrimazole, ketoconazole, posacanazole, and miconazole.These medications can interact with other medications, so be sure to tell your doctor what medications you conditions you have. They can also have side effects, so call your doctor if you develop any new symptoms while taking these medications.

, Infants that develop a thrush infections typically have the white, patchy, lesions, in their mouth. They may have trouble feeding, and be more fussy and irritable.The infant can pass the infection to the mother, then they continue to pass it back and forth, until the infection is effectively treated.The mother’s breasts can become unusually sensitive and reddened, with cracked and itchy nipples. The circular area around the nipple, called the areola, can turn shiny, with flaky skin areas.The mother may experience pain during nursing or notice pain in the nipple area between feedings. The discomfort may also feel like stabbing pains deeper within the breast., Tell your doctor if your baby has a diaper rash also, as candida may also cause a diaper rash, and your baby may need different treatment for this. If your doctor considers the case to be mild, he or she may recommend just using good hygiene measures, and watching the areas in both baby and mom for a few days.Treat the baby. If treatment is warranted, the medications can be easily and safely applied.In many cases, an antifungal product called nystatin suspension, can be prescribed. This is a liquid medication that can be applied directly into the baby’s mouth to the areas involved.
The applications are often recommended several times a day for about a week.Treat mom. To allow the mother to continue breast feeding and disrupt the cycle of passing the infection back and forth, the same medication, or a similar one, may be prescribed.
Topical antifungal creams or ointments are applied to the affected areas of the nipple on mom’s breast. Applications are usually recommended several times a day, for about a week, until both baby and mom are symptom free.You may also want to consider using disposable nursing pads to avoid passing the infection to your clothing.Talk to your doctor about cleaning or boiling items such as bottles and nipples, pacifiers and any detachable parts of a breast pump to reduce the chance of the infection coming back.

, People that are diabetic, are prescribed inhaled corticosteroids, take certain types of antibiotics, and people that wear dentures, develop oral thrush infections more often than otherwise healthy adults.Some people with serious illnesses that involve weakened immune systems more commonly experience oral candidiasis.These groups include people with HIV or AIDS, people receiving cancer treatments, and people that have had organ transplants., Make an appointment as soon as possible to have the thrush infection evaluated and treated.The doctor will choose the appropriate prescription medications based on the overall health and existing medications of the person with thrush.People that are elderly, have asthma or COPD, and people with weakened immune systems require quick intervention to prevent the thrush from spreading into their bloodstream.

, The at-risk groups are more challenging to treat since most are already taking a combination of medications that can sometimes interact with antifungal drugs.


The doctors know how to properly combine the antifungal medications needed, with their current prescribed drugs, to quickly and effectively treat the thrush infection.In some cases, intravenous therapy and hospitalization may be the safest course of action., One scientific research study looked for evidence of efficacy for natural and herbal products claiming efficacy in treating oral candidiasis. Unfortunately, the researchers were not able to find any evidence to support the claims.This does not mean the natural and herbal products do not work. The study results suggest that further studies, following proper scientific research methods, are warranted in order to show efficacy for these treatment approaches., When you have a thrush infection, warm saltwater rinses may provide some relief.Ask your dentist or doctor about using saltwater rinses to be sure it is the best option for you.To make a saltwater rinse, dissolve ½ teaspoon of salt in 1 cup of warm water.
Swish the rinse around in your mouth. Be sure to spit out the rinse and avoid swallowing it. Repeat this several times a day., Scientific research has shown that probiotics containing the lactobacilli species can help to control the overgrowth of candida albicans in some situations.The study authors recommend additional research in this area, but the initial work done in a controlled research setting was promising., The scientific literature suggests this to be possibly helpful in treating thrush. However, products available are not adequately regulated and exact dosing recommendations are not available.Talk to your doctor about specific products or sources, recommended by him or her, to treat thrush in this manner.Yogurt containing live or active cultures of the lactobacilli species are difficult to find. Yogurt products are now required to undergo processes like pasteurization that kills the live cultures.

, If you choose to try gentian violet, talk with your doctor first, then proceed carefully. Since safer and easier products are available, using gentian violet is often considered to be unfavorable option.


Gentian violet is effective in the topical treatment of fungal infections, including oral candidiasis, but the product is difficult to use. The product should not be swallowed, and will stain the skin and clothing.Side effects of gentian violet include redness, and irritation at the site where it is applied. Gentian violet should not be swallowed. Diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting can result. If gentian violet is swallowed, call a poison control center.One study found that gentian violet applied topically using a 0.00165% product was somewhat effective at treating oral thrush and did not stain the affected areas., See your dentist regularly, and follow recommendations provided by your dentist or your regular doctor.General recommendations to prevent thrush infections include brushing your teeth at least twice each day, floss once a day, and never share your toothbrush., Some people have trouble reaching all areas of their mouth with a regular toothbrush.Talk with your dentist about switching to an electric toothbrush if this will help you to more effectively clean your teeth., If you have recently had a thrush infection, you may want to replace your toothbrush several times.Use new toothbrushes, and discard any contaminated ones, until you are comfortable that the infection has been effectively treated, and your new toothbrush has not been contaminated., Some mouthwashes and rinses can alter the normal flora in your mouth, and allow for the candida infection to get started more easily.Talk to your dentist to be sure. Many dentists recommend the use of mouthwashes and mouth rinses., Sugary foods, and foods and beverages that contain yeast, can encourage the growth of candida.


Limit the amounts of these foods that you eat or drink, and be sure to brush your teeth after eating., People that wear dentures at a higher risk of developing oral thrush infections.Your dentist can suggest different products and equipment to use in cleaning your dentures if this is happening to you., By maintaining tight control of your blood sugar levels, you can reduce the amounts of excess sugars that are found in your saliva.This helps to limit the sugary food source in your mouth area that helps the candida yeast to grow., Research has provided good evidence that this can help reduce the risk of oral candidiasis infections in people receiving cancer treatments.The most commonly prescribed prescription strength mouth rinse contains a solution of 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate., Some people with lung conditions, like asthma and COPD, regularly use inhaled corticosteroids.If you can, use a spacer (or aerochamber) attached to your inhaler. This greatly reduces oral thrush from using inhaled corticosteroids. Both children and adults should use spacers. In addition, they help the medication go deeper into the lungs instead of to the back of the mouth.


People that use these products can reduce their risk for getting thrush by rinsing their mouth with water, or a doctor recommended mouth rinse, after each use of their inhaler."	0
"We had a speaker come in to our school once and he explained it like this:

The first thing you have to understand is that the Roma are different. They have a different culture, they have a different way of thinking, they have a different idea of how life should be lived. Part of the problem is that it clashes with other peoples ideas on how to live.

Partially, its a problem of perception. The Roma see mainstream society as something separate from themselves that they want little part of while society can't understand why the Roma desire separatism. 

Most Roma live in Europe and mainstream European society is very different to how they live. Mainstream European society says you have to go to school, go to work, pay taxes, buy a home, respect the law but most importantly, with respect to the Roma at least, respect some fundamental authorities.

The problem is, the authorities are generally perceived as the enemy by the Roma, because they try to force the Roma to integrate, which many don't want to do.

So the encounters they have with the authorities and mainstream society goes like this:

""You can't live here. This is our land. you're not allowed.""
""Where are you kids? Why aren't they in school? We don't care about you ways. This is our land and while you're on our land, you have to send you're kids to our schools to learn our ways!""

So the Roma end up marginalised and end up perceiving mainstream society as an enemy wanting to destroy them and so it's OK to steal, its ok to disobey the rules and break the laws. Especially since some think it's the only way to survive.

meanwhile, everyone else is saying, why the fuck would you want to live your way? our way is better! we're richer and more powerful, look at all the things we have that you don't. and all you have to do to get them is be like us. Your way is stupid and outdated. Accept it and move on.

Apparently part of this is that huge amounts of Roma culture have effectively been destroyed by generations of persecution. So to most Europeans, they just look like us but poorer, clinging to stupid ways while to the Roma, they're the last generations desperately fighting to preserve themselves as a people."	0

"The authors present ""Fine-Grained Action Repetition"" - a new approach that allows agents to repeat their actions over multiple timesteps during reinforcement learning.
They show how they can use this technique to improve upon several existing RL methods across various domains including video games like Mario Bros or driving simulators.  The results are very promising but I think there is still room for improvement before one could say that these techniques have been fully explored. 
I would recommend adding some more details about what exactly happens when using Fi-GAR? How does the repetition work?  What kind of information do you need to store/update while doing so?
In addition, I'd suggest providing additional experiments where your method competes against other state-of-the-art approaches instead of just comparing to vanilla baselines."	1

"  The ACS Survey of Galactic Globular Clusters, an HST Treasury Project, will
deliver high quality, homogeneous photometry of 65 globular clusters. This
paper introduces a new collection of stellar evolution tracks and isochrones
suitable for analyzing the ACS Survey data. Stellar evolution models were
computed at [Fe/H]= -2.5, -2.0, -1.5, -1.0, -0.5, and 0; [alpha/Fe]= -0.2, 0,
0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8; and three initial He abundances for masses from 0.1 to

luminosity from Mv~14 up to the tip of the red giant branch. These are
complemented by a set of He-burning tracks that extend from the zero age
horizontal branch to the onset of thermal pulsations on the asymptotic giant

"Gangstalking is a particular manifestation of paranoid schizophrenia.  Specifically, that ""everybody is out to get me"".

The internet has enabled paranoid schizophrenics to network, sharing and reinforcing their delusion.  This has resulted in a fairly standardized presentation with shared terminology and perceived tactics.

The ""targets"" of gangstalking believe that they are the target of a *vast* conspiracy.  So vast that literally every person they see or talk to is a member.  This conspiracy expends vast amounts of time and money to, say, beam intrusive thoughts into their heads with top secret technology; frame them for crimes; break into their homes to tamper with things; and generally annoy them in extremely petty ways.  For example, it's common to believe that multiple people will pass them, each saying one syllable of a slur.

Here's a ""comic"" that explains gangstalking from the perspective of a victim:  [Targ the Target](_URL_0_).  Edit: Because a lot of people have been confused, I want to be clear.  *Targ the Target* is not a parody or a description of the condition from the outside.  It's written by a woman who suffers from the delusion, and is 100% serious.  Targ appears to be a composite of herself and other sufferers."	0

"  Ultraviolet (UV) galaxies have been selected from GALEX. The presence of a
FUV-dropout in their spectral energy distributions proved to be a very complete
(83.3%) but not very efficient (21.4%) tool for identifying Lyman Break
Galaxies (LBGs) at z~1. We divide the LBG sample into two sub-classes: red LBGs
(RLBGs) detected at 24 micron which are mainly Luminous IR Galaxies (LIRGs) and
blue LBGs (BLBGs) undetected at 24 microns down to 83 microJy. Two of the RLBGs
are also detected at 70 micron. The median SED of the RLBGs is similar (above
lambda~1 micron) to the dusty starburst HR10. However, unlike local (U)LIRGs,
RLBGs are UV bright objects. We suggest that these objects contain a large
amount of dust but that some bare stellar populations are also directly
visible. The median SED of the BLBGs is consistent with their containing the
same stellar population as the RLBGs but with a lower dust content. The
luminosity function of our LBG sample at z~1 is similar to the luminosity
function of NUV-selected galaxies at the same redshift. The integrated
luminosity densities of z~1 LBGs and NUV-selected galaxies are very consistent.
We show that star formation rates (SFRs) estimated from UV measurements and
corrected using the IRX-beta method provide average total SFR_TOT in agreement
with SFR_UV + SFR_dust. However, IRX-beta-based SFR_TOT shows a large
dispersion. Summing up the detected UV (1150A rest-frame) and IR-based star
formation rates of the detected objects, we find that only one third of the
total (i.e. UV + dust) LBG SFR resides in BLBGs and two thirds in RLBGs, even
though most LBGs at z~1 are BLBGs. On the other hand, the total SFR of LBGs
accounts for only 11% of the total SFR at z~1. Finally, we observe a regular

By reverse engineering it and then patching their own version of it, which is called piracy or hacking. This can be done by using software that allows you to see how other people have written programs (disassemblers) as well as tools like hex editors and debuggers. They also use emulators in order to run the game on another platform so they don't need an original copy anymore. Pirates are able to make money from this because there aren't any laws against selling modified versions of video games. The only way to stop them would be if publishers made sure all copies were identical but that's not possible with digital distribution methods such as Steam. By doing this hackers will find out what parts of the program work together and where bugs occur.  Hackers may even try to create new viruses/trojans/malware to attack computers running these games.

"The authors present SGDR, an algorithm that combines stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and warm restarts to solve convex optimization problems.
They show how this method can be used in practice on several machine learning tasks including matrix factorization, logistic regression, support vector machines, and deep neural networks.  They also provide theoretical guarantees of convergence under certain conditions. 
I think it is very interesting work which will have many applications. 

It would benefit from some more details about the implementation as well as additional experiments showing scalability improvements over existing methods.  

Overall I recommend publication after minor revisions are made. The manuscript has been revised according to your comments. We hope you find them useful! 
We thank all referees who participated in our double-blind reviewing process."	1

, They may have heard what other patients prefer, or what test strips are the least expensive.

, Tell them the details on the prescription and ask what blood sugar meters and test strips are covered under your plan.


Remember that it is better to get a blood sugar meter and diabetes supplies that are reimbursed by your insurance plan if possible. If you get a free blood sugar meter but it is not approved by your insurance company, you will end up paying for future supplies out of pocket.
Also, ask what pharmacies are covered by your insurance. In some cases, mail order pharmacies will offer free blood sugar meters, and they are allowed to send you a 90-day supply of test strips.

, Start to do research on free meters based on the companies that are included in the list.

, You may need to do some math to figure out your out of pocket expense.

, Diabetic Living Online does comprehensive research on different types of meters, at diabeticlivingonline.com/monitoring/blood-sugar/glucose-meter-buying-guide.


Consider other factors than cost when choosing your blood sugar monitor. For example, you may want to look for multi-site tests, so you can draw blood from places other than your finger. If you have eyesight problems, you will want a large display. If you want to track your readings, you will want a device with large memory or 1 that can be loaded on to the computer. You may choose to pay $10 to $100 for the device that will save you time, money and hassle in the future.

, Most people will get their test strips from a prescription, so they will return to the same location for their test strips. Wait to do some research before buying your first meter and strips.

, Factor how much money your health insurance company will provide to find the least expensive strips.

, Type in the name of the company and ""blood sugar meter"" to find the site dedicated to these products.

, In some cases, you can sign up to receive a free blood sugar meter.


Make sure to read the fine print, to see if other purchases are necessary to receive the blood sugar meter.

, You may need to enter insurance information to receive the meter.

,, Ask if they provide free meters with a regular test strip prescription.


Make sure to specify what types of meters are covered by your insurance.

,, Costco, Target, Walmart and other stores may run promotions for free meters. Switch to a different pharmacy if the promotion is good.


Once you have received your free monitor and filled your required prescriptions, you may be able to switch back to your old pharmacy.

, Type the name of the monitor, plus the word ""free"" into a search engine. Look through the results to find limited-time offers.

, You may be able to find it for a lower price or for free with the purchase of test strips.

, Ask if you can apply to receive free diabetes testing supplies.

"I'm a neuroscientist, and someone who likes beer probably more than he should, so I think I'm in a perfect position to answer this.

Your question is perfect. What it demonstrates is that a hangover cannot *just* be dehydration and lack of sleep (let's forget ""mild alcohol poisoning"" because that doesn't make much sense for a bunch of reasons).

Let me take this in what seems like a different direction: Did you know that people with epilepsy can often suffer from seizures the morning after heavy drinking? Why might that be? Also, very heavy drinkers often have seizures when they stop drinking. Why might that be?

The answer to both of these questions comes down to one fact, and one general principle of biology. First: Alcohol makes the main ""inhibitory"" neurotransmitter in your brain more effective. What does that mean? A neurotransmitter is a chemical that is released from one brain cell to talk to another. Generally speaking, neurotransmitters make the cell that receives the neurotransmitter either MORE likely to release neurotransmitter themselves, or LESS likely to release neurotransmitter themselves. A inhibitory neurotransmitter is the last one. An alcohol makes it work better.. making it even more potent at telling brain cells stop releasing neurotransmitter.

The general principle in biology I was talking about is called ""homeostasis"" and it means that if you exert some change on the body, the body tries to reverse it. While it doesn't always happen, in this case it does: alcohol makes the inhibitory neurotransmitter more effective, so the brain does a variety of things to reduce the effectiveness of the inhibition.

The problem then comes when the alcohol is removed from your body. Your brain has turned down the level of inhibition, and with no alcohol floating around, this lowered level of inhibition does not make you feel great. In people prone to seizures already (i.e. epileptics) it can be enough to trigger a seizure. In non-epileptic people, it just makes you feel gross (and is why, I guess, that sometimes after drinking, you end up waking up earlier than normal, and can't sleep, even though you feel terrible).

By resupplying a little bit of alcohol, you are turning the level of inhibition back up a bit, giving your brain time to readjust it's inhibition back to normal levels.

I know I've gone a bit above ELI5 levels. Sorry about that."	0
"I found this paper very original and thought-provoking, but also a bit difficult to understand. It is very exciting to see a practical use case for image-generating GANs, with potentially meaningful benchmarks aside from subjective realism.

I found eq. 4 interesting because it introduces a potentially non-differentiable black-box function Stego(...) into the training of (S, G). Do you in fact backprop through the Stego function?

- For the train/test split, why is the SGAN trained on all 200k images? Would it not be cleaner to use the same splits for training SGAN as for ""steganalysis purposes""? Could this account for the sensitivity to random seed shown in table 2?
- Sec. 5.3: ""Steganographic Generative Adversarial Networks can potentially be used as a universal tool for generating Steganography containers tuned to deceive any specific steganalysis algorithm."". This experiment showed that SGAN can fool HUGO, but I do not see how it was ""tuned"" to deceive HUGO, or how it could be tuned in general for a particular steganalyzer.

Although S* seems to be fooled by the proposed method, in general for image generation the discriminator D is almost never fooled. I.e. contemporary GANs never converge to actually fooling the discriminator, even if they produce samples that sometimes fool humans. What if I created an additional steganalyzer S**(x) = S*(x) * D(x)? This I think would be extremely difficult to fool reliably because it requires realistic image generation.

After reading the paper several times, it is still a bit unclear to me how or why precisely one would use a trained SGAN. I think the paper could be greatly improved by detailing, step by step, the workflow of how a hypothetical user would use a trained SGAN. This description should be aimed at a reader who knows nothing or very little about steganography (e.g. most of ICLR attendees).

"  We study the dynamics and resulting score distribution of three-agent games
where after each competition a single agent wins and scores a point. A single
competition is described by a triplet of numbers $p$, $t$ and $q$ denoting the
probabilities that the team with the highest, middle or lowest accumulated
score wins. We study the full family of solutions in the regime, where the
number of agents and competitions is large, which can be regarded as a
hydrodynamic limit. Depending on the parameter values $(p,q,t)$, we find six
qualitatively different asymptotic score distributions and we also provide a
qualitative understanding of these results. We checked our analytical results
against numerical simulations of the microscopic model and find these to be in
excellent agreement. The three agent game can be regarded as a social model
where a player can be favored or disfavored for advancement, based on his/her
accumulated score. It is also possible to decide the outcome of a three agent
game through a mini tournament of two-a gent competitions among the
participating players and it turns out that the resulting possible score
distributions are a subset of those obtained for the general three agent-games.
We discuss how one can add a steady and democratic decline rate to the model
and present a simple geometric construction that allows one to write down the
corresponding score evolution equations for $n$-agent games.

" And just like anything we do in life, fear comes from ‘not knowing’. So imagine what you could accomplish if you could perform home wiring safely and confidently. Imagine saving thousands of dollars over the years, if you could do-it-yourself!;
, It’s very important that you do not get in a hurry. Make sure that you have planned your project adequately, and that you’ve allowed plenty of time to complete your project, or at least if you have to pull off of it and come back to it later, that you find a suitable stopping point, and that you can do without the circuit that you’re working on.

, It’s not only dangerous. It is lethal. Shut the power off to any circuit that you are working on. (This means turn the power off at the circuit breaker panel. Just switching off a wall switch does not turn off the power in the wires.) Confirm the power is off with a simple pocket tester, a multi-meter, or lamp, blow dryer or another similar appliance.

,, Fiberglass ladders are non-conductive. Don’t use an aluminum ladder. Spend the money for a good fiberglass stepladder.

,, Never work barefoot or in socks or slippers, and don’t assume that it’s safe to work without rubber-soled shoes on concrete floors. Concrete is conductive, particularly when it’s damp (a good reason to never load or unload your washing machine while you’re barefoot).

, Even if by definition it’s called an insulator. (A conductor allows the flow of electrons, and an insulator resists the flow of electrons).

, OSHA requires us as contractors to lock it off, and tag it out with a procedure called lock out/tag out. It involves red tags and devices that will lock the breaker off to prevent it from being turned on. (If you have your panel cover off, remember that even when you turn breakers off, there are still energized components in the panel itself!).

, or “Danger�?, or something similar, so anybody who approaches that panel will see that, and immediately know what’s going on.

,, Put your other hand either in your pocket or behind your back, and that’s a good practice to develop anyway. What that does is keeps you from grabbing a circuit with two hands and providing a path for the electricity to flow through your heart.

,, It is well worth spending a little extra money to purchase quality tools. I’m referring to hand tools like your lineman pliers, screwdrivers, wire strippers, and other hand tools that you will use for electrical work. For instance, Good wire strippers will prevent you from nicking or skinning the wires. Good screwdrivers will prevent slipping out of screw heads or rounding them out. You get my point; good tools not only improve the quality of your workmanship, but improve your confidence as well. So don’t skimp on tools. You can stock your tool pouch with good quality tools for $100 or less.

"To everyone on this thread debating the safety of LSD:
Everyone's mind reacts differently to hallucinogens so let's not try to pretend like there is one answer for everyone concerning the whether or not it's safe. For example, I have dropped acid somewhere over 40 times (ballpark) and it has had no lasting effects on me. However, the very first time a very close friend of mine tripped, it changed him forever. Not only did he have an extreme reaction during the trip but now (almost 3 years later) he's schizophrenic. 

I want to be clear that the reason it affected him so adversely is because he was predisposed to developing schizophrenia and LSD was just the straw that broke the camels back. However, there no way to know the mental predisposition that a person might have most of the time. 

Anytime try a hallucinogen you roll the dice because there's no way to tell how you'll react or what the lasting affects might be. Don't believe the people on here who say it's completely safe or that it's super harmful because the truth is it's just a gamble."	0

"Paul Friedrich Nietzsche (/ˈnɪtsʃə, -ʃə/; German: [ˈpaʊ̯l ˈniːtschə]; 25 October 1844 – 30 August 1900) was a German philosopher and cultural critic who exerted considerable influence on 20th-century intellectual history. His work has been described as the ""greatest critique of Western civilization in the 19th century""[1][2][3][4] or ""the most radical critique ever written""[5] by scholars such as Richard Dawkins[6] and Daniel Dennett[7] respectively.
Nietzsche's philosophy is characterized by his rejection of traditional metaphysics, morality, religion, society, art, science, logic, language, reason, and truth—in favor of what he called ""transcendence above good and evil""—and his advocacy of vitalism, will to power, Übermensch, eternal recurrence, Dionysian mysticism, perspectivism, existential nihilism[8] and ressentiment[9] among other ideas."	1

"  To enlighten the nature of the order-disorder and order-order transitions in
block copolymer melts confined in narrow capillaries we analyze peculiarities
of the conventional Landau weak crystallization theory of systems confined to
cylindrical geometry. This phenomenological approach provides a quantitative
classification of the cylindrical ordered morphologies by expansion of the
order parameter spatial distribution into the eigenfunctions of the Laplace
operator. The symmetry of the resulting ordered morphologies is shown to
strongly depend both on the boundary conditions (wall preference) and the ratio
of the cylinder radius and the wave length of the critical order parameter
fluctuations, which determine the bulk ordering of the system under
consideration. In particular, occurrence of the helical morphologies is a
rather general consequence of the imposed cylindrical symmetry for narrow
enough capillaries. We discuss also the ODT and OOT involving some other
simplest morphologies. The presented results are relevant also to other
ordering systems as charge-density waves appearing under addition of an ionic
solute to a solvent in its critical region, weakly charged polyelectrolyte
solutions in poor solvent, microemulsions etc.

Hitler did not trust anyone who wasn't loyal to him and his party. He also didn't like people telling him what to do because it made him feel weak. The only person that could give advice to Hitler would be himself since no one else had any power over him besides Stalin's army in Russia which they were fighting at this time. This is why Hitler always thought of everything before making decisions without consulting with others. Because he knew all there was to know about warfare from reading books written by military experts throughout history. Also if you look closely into most battles fought during WWII you'll see that Hitler won every battle except for Stalingrad where he lost half of Germany's soldiers. If Hitler listened to other people's opinions then maybe things wouldn't have turned out so well but that's just my opinion. Hitler did not listen to anybody unless they agreed with him 100%.

"The Master of Health Administration (MHA or M.H.A.), or Master of Healthcare Administration, is a master's-level professional degree granted to students who complete a course of study in the knowledge and competencies needed for careers in health administration, involving the management of hospitals and other health services organizations, as well as public health infrastructure and consulting. Programs can differ according to setting; although practitioner-teacher model programs are typically found in colleges of medicine, health professions, or allied health, classroom-based programs can be found in colleges of business or public health.

Structure
The degree program is designed to give graduates of health disciplines (in particular) greater understanding of management issues and prepare them for senior management roles, and is awarded by many American, European, Australian, Indian and Sri Lankan (Post Graduate Institute of Medicine – University of Colombo) universities. 
The degree traditionally focuses on health administration at the local, state, and federal level as well as in the nonprofit sector. This contrasts with the general Master of Business Administration or the Master of Public Administration degrees.

Accredited programs of study typically require students to complete applied experiences as well as course work in areas such as population health, healthcare economics, health policy, organizational behavior, management of healthcare organizations, healthcare marketing and communications, human resource management, information systems management and assessment, operations assessment and improvement, governance, leadership, statistical analysis and application, financial analysis and management, and strategy formulation and implementation.

MHA programs are thus intended to provide students with the essential knowledge required for senior managerial and planning work in the health services and systems sectors. The objectives of the program are to develop graduates who are: competent general and financial managers, competent planners, knowledgeable about public health and the structure, organization and financing of health care systems, knowledgeable about society, law and ethics, and competent in quantitative skills. ""Health care is a labor intensive industry, no doubt about it and it’s not likely to change in the near future. Leadership of this human capital is uniquely challenging because of the diversity of both the workforce and the customer base and because of the life and death nature of our work."" - Dr. RuthAnn Althaus

In most countries, applicants are required to hold, at minimum, a four year undergraduate degree and have a minimum period of professional experience in the health system. The curriculum, however, varies between universities.

United States

Although many colleges of business, public health, and/or health sciences in the United States have degrees with health administration content, only a minority have been accredited through the Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Management Education (CAHME), which is the only accreditor recognized by the United States Department of Education for these programs.  In the same way the AACSB evaluates accreditation for MBA programs; CAHME accreditation requires programs to meet a set of standards related to areas such as program resources, faculty preparation, curriculum content, and post-graduation career success, and also helps to ensure that the programs are well integrated with the practice communities their graduates will work within.

Applicants to accredited programs are required to hold a four-year undergraduate degree prior to enrolling.  Some universities offer dual MBA/MHA degrees with AACSB accreditation, or MBA/HOM degree programs, which may be completed concurrently or sequentially.   Some MHA programs do not require professional experience prior to enrollment; however, most programs require work experience, such as internships or fellowships, as part of their graduation requirements.  Some MHA programs use a blended lecture and online format, allowing people to continue working while they pursue the MHA degree.  There are also a few universities, including many for-profit universities, that offer Master of Healthcare Administration programs completely online; however, these programs are not currently eligible for CAHME accreditation because of concerns about the effectiveness of online programs as an analog for developing interpersonal and team-based skills which are more typically face-to-face in their use in post-graduation professional roles.

Most Master of Healthcare Administration-equivalent graduate programs in the United States are offered by schools of public health, business, allied health, or, less frequently, by schools of medicine.  Programs in schools of public health or business tend to have a more 'traditional' structure; courses are typically taught by academicians and have a focus on theory as well as analysis.  In the United States, the official academic honor society for Master of Healthcare Administration graduates is Upsilon Phi Delta.

Australia

In Australia the Master of Health Administration may be divided in two parts; the first part awards a graduate diploma of Health Service Management, and, depending on the outcome, diplomates may be permitted to continue to the second part which culminates in the Master of Healthcare Administration degree. Course structures, and be either research or coursework based. The Master of Health Administration is considered the benchmark qualification by the Australasian College of Health Services Management and the Royal Australasian College of Medical Administrators. Unlike elsewhere, the Master of Healthcare Administration is not intended primarily for medical practitioners (who have courses provided by their professional organisations) but is open to graduates of any discipline wishing to pursue a career in health administration.  Owing to the wide variety of course nomenclature in Australia, some universities offer the course as a Master of Business(Health Administration), abbreviated to MBus(Hlth).

"The main contribution of this work is to propose an algorithm for learning policy search from data generated by stochastic dynamical systems using neural networks as function approximators.
In particular, it presents two algorithms that are based on variational inference techniques (VI) combined with Monte Carlo sampling methods such as particle filters.  The proposed method can be used when there exists no analytical solution available but only samples obtained through simulation experiments. 
This approach has been applied successfully to several problems including optimal control design under uncertainty where the objective was to maximize expected discounted reward over infinite horizon. 

Strengths: 
1. It provides new insights into how VI could be implemented efficiently within MCMC framework; 2. It proposes novel approaches combining VI-MCMC with PFs which have not yet appeared elsewhere"	1

forming region, is a rare wide-separation brown dwarf binary. XMM-Newton and
Chandra observations of 2M1101AB have allowed us to examine the influence of
physical parameters (mass, bolometric luminosity and effective temperature) on
X-ray emission from a coeval pair of substellar objects. The spatial resolution
of XMM-Newton is not sufficient to separate contributions from the two
components in the binary. The X-ray source detected with XMM-Newton has a
column density compatible with the infrared extinction of component A. On the
other hand, the binary is resolved with Chandra, and the bulk of the X-ray
emission is clearly associated with the photospherically cooler component B.
These apparently contradictory results point at strong variability of 2M1101's
X-ray emission. Combined with previous sensitive X-ray observations from
low-mass members of ChaI, we find a decline of X-ray luminosity with decreasing
(sub)stellar mass that is typical for star forming regions. 2M1101B is the
coolest (spectral type M8.25) and least massive brown dwarf of ChaI detected in
X-rays so far. It is also among the youngest (~1 Myr) substellar ChaI members,
and therefore relatively luminous. Most bona fide brown dwarfs of Cha I have
remained below the sensitivity limits of available X-ray observations, because
of their low luminosity associated with higher age.

"Windows Vista introduced several advanced power saving features such as:  Idle Time Limitation: The operating system limits how long applications can be left running without user interaction.  Standby Mode: When you are not using your PC or laptop, it goes into standby mode where only essential components like hard disk drive spin up while other devices remain powered down.   Hybrid Boot: If there was no activity from the last boot cycle (e.g. mouse movement), then the next boot cycle starts with minimal services loaded so less energy is consumed during this period.    In addition, some hardware manufacturers have also implemented their own proprietary power-saving solutions through software drivers provided along with their products. These include:    AMD Cool'n'Quiet Technology: It allows users to adjust processor clock speed according to workload requirements.     ATI Catalyst Control Center: Users may choose different levels of performance depending upon application needs.

" The obvious difference is not just that the 310 has more controls to operate the engines, it also has many more features in all parts of the aircraft. (covered later)

A first glance inside the cockpit at the 310 panel will reveal many more instruments and controls, and more modern ones.

,
Two tachometers
Two manifold pressure gauges
Two sets of engine temperature and pressure gauges.;
,,

The most noticeable difference, for this article, is in the Dual Control Pedestal.
The controls from left to right are:
Two throttles.
Two propeller controls.
Two fuel mixture controls.
Two fuel tank controls. Under the pedestal.

,

This panel has the newer ""Glass Panel"" which has all the instrumentation of the six pack panel, but concentrated into one glass panel, in a different format where airspeed and altitude are in vertical bar displays.
Note that three round gauges below the glass panel, were kept for backup. In case of glass panel failure.
Airspeed Indicator.
Artificial Horizon.
Altimeter.

, Memorize these speeds, you are sure to be asked about them in the oral test. These speeds vary with each aircraft, check in the manual of your aircraft.

VMC-93 knots. Minimum control speed. The airspeed, below which, the aircraft cannot be controlled, in flight with one engine out.
Vyse-106 knots. Best-Rate-of-Climb. The speed giving the best climb on one engine.
Vxse-95 knots. Best-Angle-of-Climb. The speed giving the best climb to clear a 50 feet (15.2 m) airport departure obstacle on one engine.

,
Must have a minimum of 10 hours of flight time, with an FAA qualified Flight Instructor, in a twin engine aircraft.
Must have made at least 5 take-offs and landings in the last 90 days, in a twin.
Sufficient training to master flight with one engine shut down.
Ground training in performing a more complicated pre-flight walk-around.
Know all the special speed, and other requirements with operation on both engines, and with one engine off.
Pass an oral exam with an FAA Inspector in all the items above.
Pass a flight check, with an FAA inspector, demonstrating all of the above.

, The following is an example of most check items, use the checklist from your aircraft manual.

Remove all control locks, internal and external, if installed.
Check condition of elevator, rudder, trim tabs, hinge bolts and actuator rods.
Check static pressure holes for obstruction.
Check baggage compartment and door.
Check ailerons in same manor as elevator.
Check Main and auxiliary fuel tank filler caps are secure.
Check landing gear for damage.
Check engine oil. Minimum 9 US quarts (9,000 ml), full 12 quarts.
Drain some fuel from strainer and check for water or contamination.
Check Main landing gear, tire, and gear door secure.
Check propeller and spinner for nicks or scratches.
Check oil filler cap.
Check cowl doors secure.
Check nose gear.
Check pitot tube for obstruction.
Check taxi light.
Be sure to perform the same checks both sides of aircraft.
Remove tie-downs.

, (Use your aircraft check list).

Landing gear switch in down position. (Before turning power on).
Elevator and aileron trimmed for takeoff.
Check throttle friction knobs for proper friction.
Set mixture to full rich.
Prop controls to full forward.
Set flaps at recommend position, some use 10degrees. Check your manual. (Do not confuse flap switch with landing gear switch).
Fuel selector valves set to main tank.
Carburetor heat, to cold (Full forward).
Check fuel gauges for sufficient fuel.
Boost pumps on.
Controls free and movement correct.
Cowl flaps open.

,

Check all 4 fuel gauges for full tank, if appropriate.
The 310 has 4 fuel tanks, two 50 gal. wing tip tanks and two 15 gallon (56.8 L). aux tanks, giving you a possible range of 1000 miles.
The total fuel weight is 1170 lbs. so beware of over loading the aircraft. You may have to leave some fuel behind.

, (If in a clear area). Follow your aircraft manual.

Start the left engine first since the battery is located there.
Start the right engine.
Check both engine instruments in the green.
Altimeter set to field elevation.
Gyros set.
Doors and windows properly locked.
Seat belts on, including passengers. (No passengers allowed until getting your Multiengine Certificate.

,

A 310 run-up will be the same as a complex single engine run-up, per engine.
Check magnetos, carburetor heat, Prop controls, per your 310 aircraft manual.

,

Before taking off from any airport in any aircraft, calculate the required runway length for your aircraft, fully loaded. See your aircraft manual.
With a multiengine aircraft, you have to check, not only the required runway length, but the ""Start-Stop"" distance for your aircraft.
Start-Stop distance is the distance required, for this aircraft to accelerate at full speed to VMC, then bring the aircraft to a full stop on the runway. The distance should be approximately 2400 feet of runway in the average 310.
Some pilots like to double this number to 5000 feet and use that as the minimum runway for this aircraft.
Single Engine Service Ceiling of a later model turbo 310 is approximately 17000 ft., but, an early model 310 is only about 7700 ft. Check your manual and memorize your maximum service ceiling. Best not to land at an airport elevation above 7000 ft. if you have an early model 310.

,

Apply both mixture controls to maximum, or as stated in your manual.
Apply both propeller controls to maximum, or as stated in your manual.
Apply both throttle controls to maximum, or as stated in your manual.
Stay on runway center line with rudder as required.
Verify max propeller to be at least 2600 RPM, or as per manual.
Check engine gauges are in the green, as required.
Watch airspeed for VMC (Velocity Minimum Control),
Do not rotate until VMC, 96knots, or as required.

, (If you need to clear a 50 ft. obstacle, use Best-angle-of-Climb.

Maintain Best-Rate-of-climb,106 knots.
Establish stabilized climb at 106 knots, Verify rate at least 500 fpm, vertical climb indicator.
Once positive climb is established, Gear up, ease flaps up (If any flap used).
Maintain climb at 25 inches Manifold Pressure at 2400 RPM until reaching desired altitude.

,

Lower nose slightly and reduce power, throttle, to 23 inches manifold pressure.
Set prop control to 2300 RPM for best cruise power of 65% power.
Maintain this power setting and hold altitude with small adjustments of yoke and throttle.
Trim as desired to maintain cruise altitude.

, You'll be tested by an FAA Inspector on engine out recognition and recovery.

Have your instructor walk you through engine out procedures, first at a safe altitude.
The instructor will show you how to tell which engine failed and how to fly the aircraft on one engine.
The instructor may kill one engine when you least expect it.
You'll have to demonstrate your ability to perform the following procedures.

,

The cockpit will suddenly get a little quieter and the aircraft will yaw in the direction of the dead engine. This is more difficult at night.
Practice this, at a safe altitude, and at night. Try using needle ball, it may help by showing the sudden change of yaw.

,

First verify the throttles are both on full power, both prop controls in full forward, and mixtures in full rich.
Some pilots use the ""Dead Foot Dead Engine"" procedure. Meaning, if the left engine failed, you'll have to push a lot of right rudder to fly straight, if left foot isn't needed, then the left engine must be dead.
Some say, ""That's simple, the prop will stop and the RPM will drop"".
Well, in actuality, the prop continues to spin at the same RPM.
A windmilling prop has the same drag as a solid disk of the same diameter so you need to get the prop feathered and stopped immediately.

,

Now that you've identified the dead engine, verify full power is applied to the good engine.

,

Reduce the drag from the bad engine prop by putting the prop into feather position. (Prop Control all the way back).
Feathering puts the prop edgeways to the wind to eliminate drag, and stop the prop from rotating.
You don't need the extreme drag of a windmilling prop which will cause the aircraft to be un-controllable.

,

Get the aircraft flying straight ahead with no loss of altitude.
Try to maintain straight ahead flight. Raising the dead engine side wing higher to balance out the good engine power and dead engine drag and yaw conditions.
Always practice dead engine procedures at a safe altitude.
Always hold the dead engine wing high until landing (but, Only if you really have a dead engine).

,


ADS-B, or (Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast), is a cornerstone of Next Generation air traffic modernization.
Mandated soon by the FAA for all aircraft operating in airspace that now requires a Mode C transponder must be equipped with ADS-B.
This new system, when properly installed and operated, will allow the pilot to see, and be seen, and avoid all other aircraft in the vicinity.
In addition to aircraft traffic, in flight services and weather information can also be sent to the pilot in flight.

"The authors present an interesting idea of using hypernetwork to represent social networks in this article.
However there are some issues that need further discussion before it can be accepted for publication.  The main issue is how do you define ""hyperedges""? In fact I think it's not necessary at all because we don't have any examples on how they work with real data sets yet. 
Another thing worth mentioning here is about the concept of ""social networks"" itself which has been discussed extensively over years but still lacks consensus among researchers as well as practitioners.   It would also help if more details were provided regarding how these concepts could be applied into practice such as identifying communities within organizations etc... 
Overall though I'm quite positive towards their ideas so I'd like them to revise again after addressing my comments above"	1
"This article presents an interesting idea about how to improve recurrent neural networks through reinforcement learning.  The authors provide several examples showing their proposed technique works well when applied to different problems such as text summarization and song composition.   However, I think there are still many open questions regarding whether these techniques will work across all applications where they could be used.    In particular,  I'm curious if the same results would hold true even without applying any additional constraints like those derived from knowledge of music theory?    Also,   it's unclear exactly why adding the extra step improves performance so much over just directly refining the network via backpropagation?  It seems likely that similar improvements might also be achieved simply by increasing the number of layers and/or neurons within each layer... 
Overall, I'd say this is a very promising area of research!"	1
"Freddie Scott (April 24, 1933 – June 4, 2007) was an American soul singer and songwriter. His biggest hits were ""Hey, Girl"", a top ten US pop hit in 1963, and ""Are You Lonely for Me"", a no. 1 hit on the R&B chart in early 1967.

Life and career
He was born in Providence, Rhode Island, United States, and sang in his grandmother's gospel group, Sally Jones & the Gospel Keyes, touring England with at the age of 12. He studied medicine at the University of Rhode Island and then at Paine College in Augusta, Georgia, but began singing again with the Swanee Quintet Juniors and gave up his medical career.

In 1956, he recorded as a secular singer with the J&S label in New York City, releasing his first solo single ""Running Home"". He also wrote the top 10 R&B hit ""I'll Be Spinning"" for the label's duo Johnnie & Joe, and his song ""Baby I'm Sorry"" was recorded by Ricky Nelson for his 1957 debut album Ricky. He was conscripted for the Korean War, but continued to record for small labels with little success. After leaving the military, he turned to songwriting, joining the Aldon Music publishing company set up by Al Nevins and Don Kirshner in the Brill Building, where he recorded many of his own demos and worked as a record producer with Erma Franklin. He also continued to release his own records, including ""Baby, You're a Long Time Dead"" for Joy Records (New York) in 1961.

In 1962, he worked with fellow songwriters Gerry Goffin and Carole King on their song ""Hey, Girl"", recording a demo for singer Chuck Jackson. When Jackson failed to come to a recording session, Scott recorded the song, and, when eventually released by the Colpix label some months later, it rose to no. 10 on both the pop and R&B charts. He followed it with a slow version of Ray Charles' ""I Got a Woman"", which again made the charts. When Colpix collapsed, he moved to Columbia, which tried to market him, with little success. He left Columbia Records in 1965, and moved to the Shout label, a subsidiary of Bert Berns' Bang Records. There, he recorded Berns' song ""Are You Lonely for Me"", reputedly requiring over 100 takes before it was finished. The record stayed at the top of the R&B charts for four weeks and reached no. 39 on the pop chart.

He followed up with a version of ""Cry to Me"", another Berns song that had previously been a hit for Solomon Burke  and Betty Harris. Although he continued to have success with R&B chart hits, including ""(You) Got What I Need"", written and produced by Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff, and a version of Van Morrison's ""He Ain't Give You None"", his career was affected by Berns' sudden death at the end of 1967. Scott continued to perform, but spent much of the next two years without a record deal. He eventually signed with the small Elephant V label, before moving on to Probe Records, where he had his last R&B hit in 1970 with a version of Bob Dylan's ""I Shall Be Released."" He continued to work with his songwriting partner Helen Miller, wrote advertising jingles, and took minor roles as an actor in films, including Stiletto. He also recorded in the early 1970s for the Vanguard, Pickwick International and Mainstream labels, and continued to perform concerts.

Scott later worked on the oldies circuit, and released a new album, Brand New Man, in 2001. He also performed ""Brown Eyed Girl"" on the Van Morrison tribute album Vanthology, released in 2003. He died in New York City in 2007 at the age of 74.

His 1968 song ""(You) Got What I Need"" was sampled for the 1989 Biz Markie hit ""Just a Friend"". It also was sampled for Ghostface Killah's ""Save Me Dear"" in 2004.

"When you make something creative (a book, a website, a painting), you get something called *copyright*. This means that you have a right to determine how people copy it; if they want to make a copy, they have to ask you for permission. The C-in-circle symbol means that the thing it's printed in/on/whatever is copyrighted.

When you sell stuff, you have certain words and phrases that are connected to your advertising for it. This includes the name of whatever you're selling, but it can also cover things like taglines and memorable characters from your ads or something. This is called *trademark*, and the TM means that the phrase right before it is trademarked.

Now, you can *register* trademarks with the federal government; prove that you've been using it for a while, and that people associate the trademark with you, and it goes on the official list. When you do this, other people get less leeway in using your trademark, and it's a lot harder for you to lose the right to it. So when a trademark is *registered*, people use the R-in-circle instead."	0
We have studied the low temperature (T < 1 K) electron spin relaxation rate, T1e-1/T1e = 1/(1 + T2e), for gold-palladium alloys with different compositions by using pulsed muon-spin rotation and relaxation measurements. The results show that the observed relaxation rates are consistent with those expected from Elliott-Yafet scattering mechanism at high temperatures but deviate significantly below 0.5 K. We find that this deviation can be explained if we assume an additional contribution to the relaxation rate due to spin-orbit interaction between conduction electrons and localized magnetic moments associated with Pd atoms. This is supported by our theoretical calculations based on density functional theory which predict a large enhancement of the spin-orbit coupling strength as one moves away from the center of the Brillouin zone towards the Fermi surface. Our findings suggest that the presence of localised magnetic moment may play an important role in determining the transport properties of these materials even though they do not order magnetically down to lowest measured temperatures.	1
"The work proposes a parallel/distributed variant of the MAC decomposition method. In presents some theoretical and experimental results supporting the parallelization strategy. The reviews are mixed and indeed a common concern among the reviewers was the choice of test problem. To me it is ok to only concentrate on a single class of problems, but in this case it needs to be a problem that the ICLR community identifies as being of central importance. Otherwise, if a more esoteric problem is chosen then I (and the reviewers) would rather see that the method is useful on multiple problems. Otherwise, it's basically impossible to extrapolate the experiments to new settings and we are forced to re-implement the algorithm. I'm not saying that the authors necessarily need to consider deep networks and there are many alternative possible models (sparse coding, collaborative filtering, etc.). But it should be noted that, without further experimental comparisons, it is impossible to verify the author's claims that the method is effective for deeply-nested models.
 
 Other concerns brought up by the reviewers (beyond the clarity/presentation issues, which should also be addressed): the experimental comparison would be more convincing with a comparison to an existing approach like a parallel SGD method. I appreciate that the authors have done a lot of work already on this problem, but doing such obvious comparisons should be the job of the author instead of the reader (focusing purely on parallelization would be ok if the MAC model was extremely-widely-used already and parallelizing was an open problem, but my impression is that this is not the case). As a minor aside, the memory issue will be more serious for deeply-nested models, due to the use of the decomposition approach (we don't want to store the activations for all layers for all examples), and this doesn't arise in SGD."	0
We report the discovery of two new evolved massive stars, IRAS 08281-4850 (HD 161797) and IRAS 14325-6428 (HD 158687), which are both classified as A-type supergiants in the literature but show strong infrared excesses indicative of circumstellar dust shells. The optical spectra obtained by us reveal that these objects have very high surface gravities for their luminosity classes, indicating they may be post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) stars. We find that the chemical compositions of these two stars are significantly different to those of normal A-type supergiants; they exhibit enhanced abundances of heavy elements such as Zr, Y, Ba, La, Ce, Nd, Sm, Eu, Yb, Hf, Ta, W, Os, Ir, Pt, Au, Hg, Tl, Pb, Bi, Th, U, and possibly also CNO-cycle products like N, O, Ne, S, Ar, Cl, K, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ge, As, Se, Br, Kr, Sr, Mo, Ag, Cd, In, Sn, Sb, Te, I, Xe, Cs, Ba, and probably also r-process elements; this is consistent with previous findings on other post-AGB stars.	1
"The authors present FractalNet which does away with residual blocks completely.  They show this architecture performs as well (or better) than ResNets when trained end-to-end using SGD.   The article also presents some interesting ideas about how such models can be used efficiently at test time.    This work makes several contributions including introducing new ways to train these types of models and showing they perform competitively against state-of-the-art methods.  

Strengths: 
1)  A novel approach to designing very large CNNs. 
2)  An efficient way to use them at test-time. 

3)  Some insightful analysis into why their model works so well compared to other approaches like ResNets.  
4)  Very nice visualizations throughout the text explaining concepts clearly. 5)  Good experimental results across multiple datasets"	1
"Game of tic-tac-toe is considered. 1029 tic-tac-toe board combinations are chosen so that a single move will result into victory of either the black or the white player. There are 18 possible moves - 2 players x 9 locations. A CNN is trained from a visual rendering of the game board to these 18 possible outputs. CAM technique is used to visualize the salient regions in the inputs responsible for the prediction that CNN makes. Authors find that predictions correspond to the winning board locations. 

Authors claim that this:
1. is a very interesting finding. 
2. CNN has figured out game rules. 
3. Cross modal supervision is applicable to higher-level semantics. 

I don't think (2) be can be claimed because the knowledge of game rules is not tested by any experiment. There is only ""one"" stage of a game - i.e. last move that is considered. Further, the results are on the training set itself - the bare minimum requirement of any implicit or explicit representation of game rules is the ability to act in previously unseen states (i.e. generalization). Even if the CNN did generalize, I would avoid making any claims about knowledge of game rules. 

For (3), author's definition of cross-modal seems to be training from images to games moves. In image-classification we go from images --> labels (i.e. between two different domains). We already know CNNs can perform such mappings. CNNs have been used to map images to actions such as in DQN my Mnih et al., or DDPG by Lillicrap et al. and a lot of other classical work such as ALVIN. It's unclear what points authors are trying to make. 

For (1): how interesting is an implicit attention mechanism is a subjective matter. The authors claim a difference between the concepts of ""what do do"" and ""what will happen"". They claim by supervising for ""what will happen"", the CNN can automatically learn about ""what to do"". This is extensively studied in the model predictive control literature. Where model is ""what will happen next"", and the model is used to infer a control law - ""what to do"". However, in the experimental setup presented in the paper what will happen and what to do seem to be the exact same things. 

For further analysis of what the CNN has learnt I would recommend:
(a) Visualizing CAM with respect to incorrect classes. For eg, visualize the CAM with respect to player would lose (instead of winning).

(b) Split the data into train/val and use the predictions on the val-set for visualization. These would be much more informative about what kind of ""generalizable"" features the CNN pays attention to. 

In summary, understanding why CNN's make what decisions they make is a very interesting area of research. While the emergence of an implicit attention mechanism may be considered to be an interesting finding by some, many claims made by the authors are not supported by experiments (see comments above).

"  By means of chemical evolution models for galaxies of different morphological
type, we have performed a detailed study of the evolution of the cosmic dust
properties in different environments: the solar neighbourhood, elliptical
galaxies and dwarf irregular galaxies. Starting from the same formalism as
developed by Dwek (1998), We have taken into account dust production from low
and intermediate mass stars, supernovae II and Ia as well as dust destruction
and dust accretion processes in a detailed model of chemical evolution for the
solar vicinity. Then, by means of the same dust prescriptions but adopting
different galactic models (different star formation histories and presence of
galactic winds), we have extended our study to ellipticals and dwarf irregular
galaxies. We have investigated how the assumption of different star formation
histories affects the dust production rates, the dust depletion, the dust
accretion and destruction rates. We have shown how the inclusion of the dust
treatment is helpful in solving the so-called Fe discrepancy, observed in the
hot gaseous halos of local ellipticals, and in reproducing the chemical
abundances observed in the Lyman Break Galaxies. Finally, our new models can be
very useful in future detailed spectro-photometric studies of galaxies.
